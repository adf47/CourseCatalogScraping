This course will introduce students to the general trends and issues of Western European history from the Scientific Revolution to the Cold War. It will be organized around such broad questions as, what is civilization?, what is the role of the individual in society and politics?, what is human nature?, and, is there progress in history? The readings will be geared toward primary sources from Hobbes and Locke through Marx, Mill, Conrad and Kennan. As students explore, interpret, discuss and write about these sources, they will become familiar with the task of the historian. The course grade is based on class participation, quizzes, a midterm and the final.

History is not just facts but interpretations of facts chosen to address particular questions. Our central question will be how did interactions among Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans in North America between 1500 and 1870 produce simultaneous tendencies towards democracy and domination? How and why did Europeans conquer the Americas? Why did they enslave Africans? How did those events influence people around the globe? How did the process of conquest and the relationships between conquerors and conquered shape the civilizations and nation states that emerged in the Western Hemisphere after 1500? Why did British North-America and the United States develop differently from most of the other nations of the Western Hemisphere? How did democratic values emerge from an imperial enterprise?

Teaching French, Italian, and German [for beginning TAs] /Advanced Topics in Foreign Language Learning and Teaching [for advanced TAs] This course supports the concept that instructional expertise is developed in and through teaching. Using a modified "lesson study model" of teacher development, new and experienced foreign language instructors will work together to identify problems of practice, discuss the theory and instructional practices that address these pedagogical concerns, and collaboratively develop a lesson to be taught by a member of the class and later analyzed and refined by the class as a whole. Videotapes of these lessons will be used as the primary source of information for analysis, discussion, and reflection. Four major areas will ground our work: 1) designing lessons to promote a language learning community, 2) teaching culture through language, and language through culture, 3) advancing oral language proficiency, and 4) developing literacy in a foreign language. Assignments include participation in collaborative lesson plan development, reflective reports on videotapes of classroom instruction, written analysis of tutorial work with language learners, and a culminating project developed in stages throughout the course that unifies the four themes in a statement of teaching philosophy. Not language specific, this course is intended for current and future teachers in the modern foreign languages.

A survey of geology designed for the non-science major. This course examines the minerals and rocks making up planet earth; the internal processes (e.g. volcanoes and earthquakes) and external processes (e.g. erosion and landslides) which shapes its surface and serve as its interaction with mankind; and concludes with a discussion of the history of North America and its residents (e.g. dinosaurs, saber-toothed tigers) over the span of Geologic Time. The importance of geology in finding fossil fuels and economic minerals, as well as warning of potential natural disasters is emphasized. The effect on modern geologic thought of the latest concepts is introduced to enable the student to develop a feel for how modern science works.

Huffman, David

Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them; and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

This course introduces students to a wide selection of Indo-European folktales as well as to perspectives and the cultural background that help understand these tales. We will examine the aesthetic, social, historical, and psychological values that these tales reflect. We will discuss theoretical and methodological models in the field of folklore studies, including formalist, socio-historical, psychoanalytic, and stylistic perspectives. We will also analyze the continuing influence of this folk tradition on popular and high culture. Upon completion of this course, students should be familiar with a wide variety of Indo-European folktales, be able to discuss several approaches to studying them, be able to identify the most important motifs of these tales, be familiar with some of the most influential folklorists, writers, and editors of the tales, and be able to assess the significance of folktales for contemporary western culture. The course grade will be calculated as follows: Attendance/Participation in recitation: 20%, Quizzes: 20%, 3 in-class examinations: 60% (20% each)

Teaching French, Italian, and German [for beginning TAs] /Advanced Topics in Foreign Language Learning and Teaching [for advanced TAs] This course supports the concept that instructional expertise is developed in and through teaching.  Using a modified "lesson study model" of teacher development, new and experienced foreign language instructors will work together to identify problems of practice, discuss the theory and instructional practices that address these pedagogical concerns, and collaboratively develop a lesson to be taught by a member of the class and later analyzed and refined by the class as a whole.  Videotapes of these lessons will be used as the primary source of information for analysis, discussion, and reflection.  Four major areas will ground our work: 1) designing lessons to promote a language learning community, 2) teaching culture through language, and language through culture, 3) advancing oral language proficiency, and 4) developing literacy in a foreign language. Assignments include participation in collaborative lesson plan development, reflective reports on videotapes of classroom instruction, written analysis of tutorial work with language learners, and a culminating project developed in stages throughout the course that unifies the four themes in a statement of teaching philosophy. Not language specific, this course is intended for current and future teachers in the modern foreign languages.

The first half of each meeting is devoted to instructional issues surrounding Public Speaking (COMMRC 0520); this segment offers case-specific guidance to new students teaching that course or planning to teach it. The second half focuses on more general and theoretical pedagogical issues. Students present a lecture, write one formal paper, and prepare a teaching portfolio, including syllabus, lesson plans, and two examinations for one communication course. Goals. 1. The course unfolds in the conviction that theory and practice can and should inform each other. The emphasis is upon developing a scholarly pedagogical praxis that works with each student’s own talents, backgrounds, elective affiliations and identities, considered beliefs, and canons of taste, and that does this in the name of an education oriented to the (deliberately evolving) common good. Thus, approaches are presented as possible alternatives in an overall educational philosophy, not as a search for the one best practice--a hopeless quest that has over the centuries too often stultified learning. 2. Out of this concern for the "big picture" the course aims at near-at-hand implementations through instruction in basic teaching techniques: course planning, syllabus writing, and assignment construction and evaluation, to name but a few.

Intro To Critical Reading

Satyavolu,Uma Ramana

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the practice of reading intelligently and critically--that is, to help students acquire the skills to interpret texts (“close reading”) and to evaluate interpretations offered by others (critical analysis). To this end, students will familiarize themselves with the schools and movements of literary theory and criticism, and understand the important critical debates and issues. But most importantly, they will study texts from various periods as well as critical essays about those texts in order to understand the nature and practice of literary criticism. This is an ambitious and, in some respects, a daunting undertaking: students will be expected to learn how to read texts, at the same time as they learn how to read and evaluate scholarly “readings” of those texts. Ultimately, this course aims to make the student familiar with what Gramsci calls “the intense labor of criticism.”

This is the first term in a two-term lecture-demonstration sequence that presents the elements of both classical and modern physics. The emphasis of the course is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles rather than on mathematical formalism and problem-solving (although some attention is given to these aspects of physics). This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below) which should be taken after Physics 0110. Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence. Subjects covered in the course include: kinematics; Newtonian mechanics; heat and heat transfers; mechanical waves and sound.

Manders,Kenneth L

We all reason, sometimes well, sometimes badly, but almost always without being self-conscious. This course aims to teach students to be self-conscious about certain aspects of their reasoning. The course will concentrate on elementary reasoning involving the so-called "Boolean" operators such as "and," "or," "not," and "if...then," and the so-called "quantifiers" such as "all" and "some." We will not treat "probabilistic" reasoning, but only reasoning in which there is a claim that the conclusion follows with dead certainty. Methods will be developed in order to test or establish such claims, e.g., the so-called methods of "truth tables" and "natural deduction." Students will be required to master these methods, and will need to apply steady effort. At the same time, learning about these methods will develop students' skills in "abstract" reasoning: reasoning about concepts and (simple) "theoretical" ideas. Logic is a theory of reasoning, and in learning it, students will get a feel for how theories work. The theory is a spectacular creative discovery, a way to get a deep understanding of reasoning by simplifying actual reasoning processes in just the right way.

This course is designed to help students to sharpen their formal reasoning skills. It introduces the basic concepts of logic, e.g., validity and consistency. And it develops techniques for determining logical properties of arguments. An especially useful technique that we shall study is that of natural deduction. We shall cover both sentential and predicate logics, but the greater part of the course will be devoted to the former.

This course surveys the various musical styles associated with Jazz beginning with the early 1800s through its present state as world concert music. This survey will include Dixieland, ragtime, blues, gospel, spirituals, rhythm and blues, rock, and soul. Recitations: Fall and spring terms only. Students must enroll in one of the several recitation sections that are held during the week. These sessions provide an opportunity for the student to participate in group discussions and to explore the material covered in the lectures. Registration in both lecture and one of the several recitation sections is required. Students should be sure to register for both at the time of registration; students who register for one but not the other will very likely find themselves closed out of the course when attempting to add the necessary section during the add/drop period.

Thompson,Michael J

In deciding how to act, we frequently guide ourselves by general principles, which forbid or require various kinds of action. Moral philosophy is the attempt to explore systematically a number of questions which arise in connection with such principles. We may ask, for example: What is it for a principle to be a moral principle? Is there one uniquely correct moral code, or is morality a matter of personal preference? What candidates for moral principles can be defended? Why should I be moral? The course will examine several of these questions and the answers suggested by classic moral philosophers such as Kant and Mill. We will also consider discussions of these issues by contemporary philosophers, as well as a concrete moral problem such as abortion. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on learning how to criticize and evaluate moral and philosophical claims, as well as developing and deepening one's own views. By examining the nature of morality, we can better decide how to live. Description from a previous instructor.

Ricketts,Thomas G

Logic concerns itself with the relation of implication between the premises and conclusion of a demonstrative argument. Implication in turn is a matter of form or structure. Phil. 1500 studies the forms of truth-functionally compound statements and the forms of universally and existentially general statements. After a review of truth-functional logic, the course concentrates on full quantificational logic with its embedded quantifiers. Students will master a notation that gives perspicuous expression to the forms of quantificational logic, and learn to use various formal techniques for establishing the presence of logical relationships like implication. The course also considers the expressive power and limitations of standard logical notation together with some of the applications of that notation. There will be two hour exams, a final exam, and approximately biweekly problem sets. Prerequisite: Phil. 0500 (Introduction to Logic) Students with strong analytic abilities who have not had Phil. 0500 may register for Phil. 1500 with the permission of the instructor.

Emphasis is given to the empirical (and conceptual) processes underlying the facilitation and suppression of behavior: e.g., primary and conditioned reinforcement ("joy"), non-reinforcement ("frustration"), punishment ("fear"), avoidance ("relief"); and to the generalization and discrimination of these processes. This course is viewed by the Psychology Department as a foundation for many higher-level courses. Recitation: Laboratory sections are designed to demonstrate some of the behavioral principles described in the lectures by using virtual rats as subjects for conditioning, extinction, generalization, discrimination, etc. Lab work accounts for approximately one-third of the grade

This course is an attempt to look at the situation on this side of the Atlantic before, during and after WWII. We shall explore the Holocaust in Europe, but pay attention to American policy and American policy makers such as Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930's and 40's and look at those factors which influenced America’s reaction. There will be an opportunity to explore some of the issues and questions that the Holocaust raises for Americans today. In addition to selected films, there will be an opportunity to meet a survivor or child of a survivor of the camps.

In so doing, the course takes full advantage of the resources of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Films and field trips attempt to bring the readings alive. As course materials are providing the students with the necessary concepts and information to understand the urban environment, the students will be developing their own investigative skills through group trips.

A sociological internship is a type of Independent Study in which the student is, in some sense, employed in a non-academic position (usually as a volunteer but sometimes for pay).  Student interns are sponsored, guided and evaluated by a faculty member (usually the Internship Coordinator).  Interns are also directly supervised by an appropriate person at the internship site.  The experience gained by the student must have direct sociological relevance.  The normal academic requirements of an internship include a research paper, a daily journal and regular communication with the faculty sponsor.

The emphasis of the course is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles rather than on mathematical formalism and problem-solving (although some attention is given to these aspects of physics). This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below) which should be taken after Physics 0110. Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence. Subjects covered in the course include: kinematics; Newtonian mechanics; heat and heat transfers; mechanical waves and sound.

Students selected for the Institute of Politics Internship will register for this course for the experiential component of their internships. The purpose of the internship experience is to provide the student with direct exposure to the process of public decision-making. Each student will spend nine hours a week working with an individual or office directly involved in the policy making process. Students will be given specific responsibilities and will be expected to be an active and integral part of the office in which they are placed. The details and terms of each placement will be carefully worked out and agreed upon by the student, the placement supervisor and the placement sponsor. Utmost care will be taken to insure that the student is placed in a situation that will maximize his/her exposure to all office activities and that the student is not left unsupervised and uninvolved. Students from all disciplines may apply, but preference will be given to students in their junior and senior years. Students must report to their placement for at least nine hours a week and fulfill any agreed upon responsibilities. Students will also be required to keep a written journal which describes and analyzes their internship experience. To apply, contact, the A&S Undergraduate Studies Academic Internship Office (412-624-5428) or the Institute of Politics (412-624-1837). If you are selected, you will be issued a &quot;Permission to Register for a Closed or Restricted Class&quot; form.

Students selected for the Institute of Politics Internship will register for this course for the experiential component of their internships. The purpose of the internship experience is to provide the student with direct exposure to the process of public decision-making. Each student will spend nine hours a week working with an individual or office directly involved in the policy making process. Students will be given specific responsibilities and will be expected to be an active and integral part of the office in which they are placed. The details and terms of each placement will be carefully worked out and agreed upon by the student, the placement supervisor and the placement sponsor. Utmost care will be taken to insure that the student is placed in a situation that will maximize his/her exposure to all office activities and that the student is not left unsupervised and uninvolved. Students from all disciplines may apply, but preference will be given to students in their junior and senior years. Students must report to their placement for at least nine hours a week and fulfill any agreed upon responsibilities. Students will also be required to keep a written journal which describes and analyzes their internship experience. To apply, contact, the A&S Undergraduate Studies Academic Internship Office (412-624-5428) or the Institute of Politics (412-624-1837). If you are selected, you will be issued a "Permission to Register for a Closed or Restricted Class" form.

Laboratory sessions are scheduled for one period each week, however, students are expected to follow their experiments during unscheduled hours.  Selected projects will provide practical experience in many of the techniques discussed in the lecture portion of this class.  These will include the polymerase chain reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis, cloning DNA fragments, bacterial transformation, restriction analysis, and the Sanger method of sequencing DNA.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.  Please note that students must register for both the pre-lab lecture and a laboratory section to earn credit.

Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

An academic internship offers students a unique learning opportunity to connect classroom knowledge with real-world settings as they explore careers and gain valuable experience. Students may earn from 1-3 credits for an experience that can be related to an academic field of study. The experience must be pre-professional in nature and must be approved by the A&S Office of Experiential Learning. Students must seek out and apply for their own internship. To look for internships, log into the Pitt Portal ("http://www.my.pitt.edu"www.my.pitt.edu), go to Career Services, then visit FutureLinks, or contact the OEL. Students who are earning credit for ARTSC 1900 internships may not receive pay. Students must work at least 120 hours over the course of the term to be eligible for the maximum of 3 credits. In order to earn credit, the student must have an A&S faculty sponsor (full-time only) who will assign related academic work. Internships are graded as S/NC. Students must submit a completed Learning Agreement form to A&S Office of Experiential Learning (B4 Thaw Hall) for approval and receive a special permission form to register for internship credit(s). Students may obtain a Learning Agreement form and more information from the A&S Office of Experiential Learning in B4 Thaw Hall or from "http://www.pitt.edu/~intern"www.pitt.edu/~intern It is expected that students will register for ARTSC 1900 during the specified Registration or Add/Drop periods.

How can we understand our world? In western culture, science dominates all our answers to this question. But there are other ways.  They can be found in the mythologies of ancient and modern peoples.  This course will compare the scientific and mythological ways of seeing the world and their more subtle connections. In particular, we will turn to the remarkable events in Ancient Greece of 800-400 B.C. and discover how the scientific approach actually grew slowly out of mythological thought itself.

The focus of this course is reading and examining the Bible as a literary text or, more accurately, as a collection of widely diverse literary texts. Most of this course will focus on narrative portions of the Bible, although we will see how other literary forms are often interwoven throughout the Bible’s stories. Among the topics we will consider in this course are: the origins of biblical texts and their historical contexts; the Bible’s own representations of history, particularly the history of Israel; the nature of God throughout the Bible; human-divine relations and covenants; different critical approaches to the Bible); the figure of Jesus; apocalyptic literature; and the various themes, motifs, and literary forms that bring these issues together. We will also look at different uses of the Bible as a way of understanding biblical narrative, including different translations and paraphrases, and Bible stories in art, literature, and popular culture.

However, prokaryotic cells will be discussed for comparative purposes.  Course material will emphasize the experimental basis for our understanding of cell biology and the relationship between structure and function.  Most of the techniques to be considered will involve biochemical and molecular biological approaches used in the study of cell function.  Thus the course will assume a familiarity with the principles of biochemistry covered in the prerequisites and will not repeat this material.  Topics will include membranes, the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cytoskeleton, cell motility, growth and division, endocytosis and exocytosis, and selected topics on the cellular biological aspects of cancer and the immune system.

The focus of this course is reading and examining the Bible as a literary text or, more accurately, as a collection of widely diverse literary texts. Most of this course will focus on narrative portions of the Bible, although we will see how other literary forms are often interwoven throughout the Bible’s stories. Among the topics we will consider in this course are: the origins of biblical texts and their historical contexts; the Bible’s own representations of history, particularly the history of Israel; the nature of God throughout the Bible; human-divine relations and covenants; different critical approaches to the Bible); the figure of Jesus; apocalyptic literature; and the various themes, motifs, and literary forms that bring these issues together. We will also look at different uses of the Bible as a way of understanding biblical narrative, including different translations and paraphrases, and Bible stories in art, literature, and popular culture.

This course surveys the various musical styles associated with Jazz beginning with the early 1800s through its present state as world concert music. This survey will include Dixieland, ragtime, blues, gospel, spirituals, rhythm and blues, rock, and soul. Recitations: Fall and spring terms only. Students must enroll in one of the several recitation sections that are held during the week. These sessions provide an opportunity for the student to participate in group discussions and to explore the material covered in the lectures. Registration in both lecture and one of the several recitation sections is required. Students should be sure to register for both at the time of registration; students who register for one but not the other will very likely find themselves closed out of the course when attempting to add the necessary section during the add/drop period.

When the Spanish conquerors arrived in Mexico and Guatemala they found large cities with impressive temples raised on tall pyramids, lavish palaces for rulers, elaborate markets, and skilled craftsmen working in gold, copper, feathers, stone pottery, and other materials.  They were astonished to find a civilization so like their own in some respects and yet so different (so "barbaric" to European eyes) in other ways.  In this course we will explore this civilization and then trace its development from its remote roots three thousand years before the arrival of Cortez.  Our exploration will center on examining the archaeological and historical evidence left by people in earlier periods and reconstructing the patterns of their lives and cultures.

This course is designed to help students improve as critical writers by becoming more observant and discriminating evaluators of how they and others use language to interpret, judge, and ultimately shape the worlds in which they live. Students will be first asked to reflect on the behavior of critics they have encountered in an effort to define what they believe good critics do. They will then be asked to test their definitions through close attention to various writing samples, including material they select as well as pieces chosen by the instructor. In keeping with the belief that critical reflection and dialogue enable both individuals and groups to improve, the course is discussion-based, and class members' progress as writers will be its steady concern. This section is best suited for students familiar with basics of grammar and composition, interested in composing more responsible and effective written opinions, and motivated to participate in conversation about reading and writing critically.

Even before the United States became a nation, authors began writing our collective history, shaping our national memory.  The stories we have told ourselves about the origins of the nation and its literature have been of key importance to the ways we understand our culture, landscape, and identity.  Yet, our "origin stories" are often complex - rife with invention, revision, distortion, and omission.  In this class, we will focus on specific instances of cultural meaning-making (or "traditions") in American literature.  Along the way, we will consider larger questions about the relationship between history, fiction, and experience.

This course introduces students to the major theories of international relations (IR). The course will provide students with an understanding of the history of IR, focusing on the often intense theoretical and methodological debates that have shaped the field. It will also provide students with a critical understanding of key concepts in international relations—including anarchy, cooperation and information—and how different understandings of these concepts animate different theoretical perspectives. Students will be challenged to think about how to construct and test theories, as well as methodological questions about the search for causal explanation in international relations. Readings will be drawn from the “classic” works of international relations theory, as well as from more recent research that critiques, refines and tests important questions in IR.

This UHC course provides an introduction to both computational and theoretical aspects of linear algebra, and is suitable for those wanting both theory and applications. Linear algebra is a combination of algebra and geometry. The geometry is relatively simple, as it only deals with lines, planes, and high-dimensional analogues. The algebra is also simple in concept, as it mostly involves adding columns and rows of numbers or multiplying a whole column or row of numbers by the same constant. In this course the geometry will be stressed by many examples in two and three dimensions, while the algebraic computations for more complicated examples will be done by computer. Use will be made of the computer algebra program Matlab, which will be introduced from scratch in this course. Majors in mathematics or any of the sciences, engineering, economics, or business will find this a valuable tool in their discipline. Among the specific applications which may be covered are computer graphics, game theory, and Leontief models in economics.

The course should be taken during the students' first semester in residence. It is designed as preparation, both for handling research and writing in all subsequent course, examination, and thesis requirements, as well as for understanding and operating within the interactive relationship of the music-research disciplines that characterizes the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Music. In particular, this course introduces students to the significant bibliographically oriented research methods and their resulting reference tools within all major disciplines of music research, as well as to their principal formats of publication. The course stimulates students to identify valid scholarly topics and to argue the need for further research, engenders critical skills for discerning the rationale and techniques used to compile and present music research information, and promulgates standards for quality in students' research and writing. In this course, music research is treated as a unified field in which the major disciplines--musicology, ethnomusicology, theory and analysis, and composition--necessarily interact to inform the most productive and significant results, even for narrowly defined research topics.

This is a self-contained course for students not majoring in the physical sciences. Lectures mainly deal with astronomical objects that lie outside the solar system. The properties of stars and processes in them are examined, including a discussion of the birth, evolution, and death of stars, and the formation of pulsars and black holes. On a much larger scale the properties and formation of galaxies and active galaxies, including exotic objects such as quasars, are discussed. Finally, the subject of cosmology and the origin and ultimate fate of the Universe are considered. Part of this course includes the requirement of one evening "field trip" to the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory. The purpose of these trips will be to tour the facility and, if possible, make observation with a telescope. On any one evening only a small fraction of the class will make a trip, so it should be possible to accommodate the students' evening schedules. A small percentage of the course grade will be based on participation in these field trips.

This is a self-contained course for students not majoring in the physical sciences. Lectures focus on practical astronomy and provide a historical perspective of our place in the Universe. Phenomena that can be readily observed with the unaided eye or a small telescope are discussed. The historical perspective starts with the earliest views, and discusses scientific discovery as a process leading up to the modern idea of the expanding Universe of galaxies. Part of this course includes the requirement of one evening "field trip" to the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory. The purpose of these trips will be to tour the facility and, if possible, make observation with a telescope. On any one evening only a small fraction of the class will make a trip, so it should be possible to accommodate the students' evening schedules. Nominally, the trips will take place on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening. Bus transportation from the Oakland campus to the Observatory will be provided.

This course introduces students to Russian fairy tales, a fascinating and productive genre of folklore that reveals a great deal about Russian traditions and modes of thought. Taking a psychological approach to the materials, the course examines not only the tales, but also the beliefs informing the magic world of these narratives. Since the humans, spirits, and beasts populating this world are richly portrayed in Russian art, a significant component of the course will consist of visual and audio representations of figures and scenes from fairy tales. We shall examine slides of posters, paintings, book illustrations, postcards, etc., and shall listen to music based on characters, situations, and narratives drawn from the tales (e.g., extracts from Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, Chaikovsky, and Mussorgsky).

Each year a separate research theme of current or historical significance to people of African ancestry is selected by students in consultation with the instructor. Understanding Media Influences, Promoting Civic Excellence, Understanding Academic Excellence, and Intimacy in African American Dating Relationships are examples of themes chosen in recent years—most often in relationship to values and cultural or spiritual identities foundationally related to the intellectual agenda of the department. Once the theme is selected, students identify in consultation with the instructor which aspect of the theme they would like to investigate. Once this is determined, the student and instructor design search strategies to locate studies related to their chosen sub-area of interest. As the literature is reviewed, the student with instructor input (a) designs methods for examining the question; (b) collects, analyzes, and interprets data of relevance to the problem; (c) prepares a PowerPoint presentation for sharing results and implications with community and faculty; and (d) presents a final report which consists of an introduction, review of the literature, report of the findings, and implications for social policy as well as individuals, family, and community (about 12 pages).

This is a standard introductory course in microeconomics. It focuses on the way the market system works. The decisions of households, firms, and governments are coordinated through markets in which prices adjust to keep buying plans and selling plans consistent. The U.S. economy relies mainly on markets to coordinate these decisions, although sometimes governments intervene. We will explore various social issues using the principles developed throughout the course. Upon completion of the course students will have a better understanding of economic problems, efficiency, laws of demand and supply, consumer choice theory, market organization, production and cost.

This course explores the transnational connections amongst different literatures, regions, and languages of the Americas, which came to be understood collectively with the 15th century European voyages as the "New World". We will raise such questions as: How does literature play a role in constructing people's visions of the world? What constitutes a literary tradition? In what traditions do the texts we read participate? How do those traditions overlap and differ? We will address these questions by reading several texts from the "New World," situating the texts with respect to one another, as well as to texts from the "Old World."

Narratives of growing up, coming of age, and achieving adulthood have been central to English-language literature, media, and culture at least since the origin of the novel. In many stories the protagonist’s arrival at adulthood is a key plot point, sometimes the critical achievement and culmination of the narrative's progress. Conversely, discourses about “failure to launch” stigmatize young people who do not achieve the markers of adulthood, while young people themselves develop a jaundiced view of “adulting” as a performance more than an accomplishment. In the United States histories of social inequality and cultural hierarchy are full of refusals to acknowledge the adulthood of women, LGBTQ people, and people of color. And while in response many have fought to be recognized as adults, a parallel tradition of writers, critics, and activists have identified adulthood itself as oppressive, and sought to envision paths that a life course could take that might be more conducive to flourishing and well-being. So: what does it mean to be an adult? How have ideas about adulthood changed across history? When was the concept of adulthood invented, and why? How does adulthood relate to narrative forms, to literary genres, to the production and consumption of media, to modes of leisure and entertainment, to writing and reading? Is adulthood for everyone, or is it the special privilege of a few? Is adulthood a good thing, anyways? In this Project Seminar students will use these questions as opportunities to cultivate research skills in social and cultural history, media and literary criticism, archival and documentary research, and oral history, interviews, and ethnography as core parts of their training in English literature studies. Each student will develop and pursue a substantial individual project over the course of the semester.

In this course, we’ll do that, but that’s only the beginning: in fact, reading the book will prompt us to ask a number of important questions about the nature and shape of literature in historical contexts.  We’ll begin by doing some in-depth research on the origins of Joyce’s masterwork and the intricate web of allusions to everything from Dublin on June 16, 1904 to the Homeric story of Odysseus.  Then, we’ll move outward to understand what Ulysses means in culture: what was the initial response to the novel, and why was it banned in so many countries?  What lifted the ban and how was the novel then marketed and sold?  How did Ulysses come to be considered a “project” that one might undertake reading, a marker of high culture, when it is also full of crude scenes, profanity, and waste?  And why did it become such an influential novel for generations of writers around the world who alternately loved and hated it—sometimes both?  In this course, you will learn methods in cultural research, high-level reading practices, writing and argumentation, and digital media skills for presenting your work.

This undergraduate seminar explores the cultural politics that surround the acquisition of ancient art and related antiquities. The subject will be approached thematically: issues of ownership, commodification, museum acquisition, private collecting, repatriation, and reburial, as well as the nationalist and religious appropriation of archaeological sites, will be discussed, with special emphasis placed on the social and economic impacts of the illicit trade in antiquities. Diverse high-profile case studies, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the treasures of Troy, Stonehenge, the Parthenon, and the recent destruction of cultural heritage in the Middle East, will be used to illustrate key problems and present possible solutions.

This course is an introduction to practical numerical methods for science and engineering. The course is complemented with a fully integrated computer laboratory, where you learn to use available software and where you learn to implement your own solution methods. Topics for the first term include: roundoff errors and stability analysis,rootfinding for nonlinear equations, interpolation, approximation of functions and numerical integration. The presented approximation methods will be combined for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. The techniques presented are frequently used to deal with problems in physics, chemistry and engineering. The lecture introduces a numerical method and elaborates on its applicability and expected behavior. Frequently you will be assigned a related laboratory exercise. The laboratory makes use of the Campus VMS and Unix machines. There are two lab sections per week; registration in one of the lab sections is required. Lab. schedule reassignment may be done to optimize equipment use. Students should keep both lab periods available if possible. The class number for the lab sessions is 11844.

Officially, what we’re doing in this course is introducing the practice of sociological research. We will go through all stages of the research process, from critically reviewing research done by others, to deriving falsifiable hypotheses, choosing appropriate data sources to test them, collecting the right data, choosing a strategy to analyze the data and test the hypotheses, and guiding future knowledge on the basis of the outcomes of the research. Unofficially, but more importantly, we are (1) developing our abilities to see often fascinating connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and (2) training ourselves to detect flaws in reasoning and argumentation that are all too common in everyday life.

Students in this course are provided with an overview of the relationship between communication and organizing processes. The course emphasizes theories, principles, and concepts of organizational communication and their practical application. Students learn to analyze the communication which occurs in organizations to recognize sources of communication breakdown and develop an awareness of strategies for prevention and/or resolution of communication on breakdown. This section is highly interactive and will be graded on the basis of participation, as well as self-assessment, goal writing, interview with a professional, resume/cover letter and marketing return on investment (ROI) assignments. A major component of the course is a formal, research-based case study analysis and presentation for a real client facing an organizational communication challenge

This course examines the phenomenon of vampirism in verbal and visual texts from different time periods in various cultures (Russia, Poland, France, England, America). Why do vampires capture the imagination especially of Anglophone readers? What qualities does the vampire incarnate? Which historical events and customs have triggered particular enthusiasm for depicting the undead? How have the depictions of the vampire evolved over centuries? Our discussions will address these issues as we analyze stories, novels, and films focusing on vampires from a variety of critical perspectives, contextualizing the works in the cultures that produced them.

This course examines Slavic and anglophone science fiction comparatively. It assesses how a given culture's dominant values are articulated in a popular genre that enjoys different status in the East (i.e., Eastern Europe) and the West (i.e., England and America). Those values emerge in works that imaginatively posit "fantastic" situations rooted in biological, spatial, and temporal explorations beyond those currently verified by science. On the basis of films (e.g., "The Terminator", "The Fly"), film clips, TV shows, novels (e.g., "Solaris", "The Futurological Congress"), novellas, and stories, we shall discuss such topics as progress, utopia, human perfectibility, the limits of science, and the nature of knowledge.

Sanskrit is the classical language of India. This course can serve as either a one-term introduction to Sanskrit, or (preferably) as a foundation for further work in the language. We will begin with the devanagari writing system and Sanskrit pronunciation. This will be followed by a survey of the essentials of Sanskrit grammar, including noun, pronoun, and verb paradigms, rules of combining sounds when words are joined to one another (sandhi), word order, and use of particles. There will not be so much focus on developing an extensive vocabulary in the first term of study; however, the course will be directed toward eventually reading material from Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata and Hitopadesa in second-year Sanskrit. A comprehensive beginning text such as Egenes, Introduction to Sanskrit, Part 1 will be covered in the Fall term.

In order to explore some of the ways in which past and present come together in our own time, we will read some recent and historical works of literature. For our purposes, the contemporary has two meanings: the first, belonging to the same age or period, and the second, related to along with its notions of change and progress ideas or texts that belong of the "modern," or having a quality of the present period. Our focus this semester will be on two questions: the construction of history and the value of memory as they become visible through slavery, colonization, love and war. Another of our principal tasks this semester will be to take up a cluster of questions about representation, namely: How is "reality" represented in literary texts, but also how do texts function to produce notions of reality?

It will show by examples how important questions about the observed world may be framed in terms of linear and nonlinear differential equations. By considering concrete problems from physics, biology, chemistry and engineering, the course will illustrate such concepts as equilibrium and stability, bifurcation, limit cycles, and chaos. The students will also learn important analytical techniques such as linearization, phase plane analysis and rescaling. Advanced topics treated in an elementary way will be hysteresis, coupled oscillators, Hopf bifurcations, and strange attractors. Applications will include mechanical vibrations, dynamics of interacting populations, biological rhytms, lasers, and if time permits, even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages.

This course will examine the relationship between children and culture from the eighteenth century to the present, focusing primarily on the United States. We will emphasize how childhood is a historically and socially constructed category informed by cultural values and norms. Learning to closely read and analyze cultural representations of children does not tell us what childhood is “really like,” but nor is it pure fiction and fantasy. The methods of reading and writing developed in this course will help students understand how images, sounds, texts, ideas, and norms comes to define what we think a child is, affecting the lives of actual children. We will focus especially on how the categories of the child and childhood have been gendered, racialized, and sexualized. We will also consider how children interact with, reinforce, and challenge cultural representations and norms through the concept of performance.

Weikle-Mills, Courtney Anne

This capstone course allows you to do upper-level work on children’s literature, YA, and youth media. As the name of this course is “Critical Approaches,” one of our main investigations concerns the very nature of “criticism.” Why do it, especially as concerns children’s literature and culture? Can criticism have a public impact? Has criticism “run out of steam,” as Bruno Latour has said? What is the opposite of criticism? Pleasure? Play? Can criticism be pleasurable or playful? Can pleasure and play be critical? This semester’s version of the course proceeds from the observation that children frequently appear in theories and criticism of American life, and that childhood can also be understood as a concept immune to or distanced from criticism, filled with pleasure and other frivolous activities. Perhaps stemming from the original metaphor of the U.S. as an “infant nation,” children have been figures for and indexes of national health, the national psyche, and national character. Simultaneously, real and fictional children have functioned throughout our history as interpreters of the culture, as key figures of the American critic. Reading key literary, cultural, and theoretical texts, we will examine the American child as a compelling object of critical attention and a participant (real or imaginary) in critical inquiries involving Americanness, as well as a figure for seemingly uncritical play. We will ultimately become critics ourselves, using the specialized knowledge that you have learned about childhood and children’s literature at Pitt to play with our books and to construct creative critiques. For that reason, this class is, at its heart, both a literature and a writing class—and we’ll be employing editing workshops so that you can get feedback as you work on both a short salon-style article and a self-designed capstone project.

Our subject will be the traditional stories--myths, legends, and folktales--of the Greeks and Romans. Traditional stories are ones that, by virtue of some compelling attraction, manage to survive from generation to generation, so our main task will be to discover just what that 'compelling attraction' was. The creation of the universe, the first woman Pandora, the Twelve Gods and Goddesses, the theft of fire by Prometheus, Helen and the Trojan War, the foundation of Rome by Aeneas, and Ovid's fanciful metamorphoses are examples of the stories from our modern illustrated reader Classical Myth by Barry B. Powell. By way of providing a context for our stories, the instructor will also devote much attention to such topics as popular belief and superstition, cult rituals, sanctuaries of the gods, oracles and prophets, the conceptualization of male and female, sexuality, and the social and cultural basis of myth in general. Throughout, we shall examine the many theories about the meaning of traditional stories from antiquity down to our own day.

The purpose of this course is to illustrate ways of looking at literary texts. We shall examine poems, prose works and plays from France and the francophone world, trying to answer some of the following questions: What are the characteristics of these different genres? What is specifically literary in the text? How can reading such a text make us more able to understand today's world? Considering these questions should make students more familiar with French-language literary production and also help them understand the literary phenomenon in general.

This course covers most of the essential political, social, and economic changes in the United States from Reconstruction to the present. Taking prominent public questions as the point of departure, the course is divided into three sections. The first covers the years from the 1870s through 1900 and focuses on the issues of money and class. The second section, 1900-1945, uses the issues of corporations and race to guide us through America’s rise to economic preeminence, two world wars, and the Great Depression. The last sections follows the issues of anti- communism and civil rights from 1945 to the 1980s. By spending most of our time on large public issues, the course ought to provide background for more advanced history courses as well as an understanding of how and why American public life has changed.

Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them; and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals; press kits; editorials; informational Web sites; articles; and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

What is literature? Is it meant to educate? Inspire? Heal? Entertain? Transcend or confront? Do the meanings found in a literary work come out of the individual reader's knowledge and experience, the author's intentions, or the structure and style of the work? In this course, we will engage such questions while reading a selection of poetry, fiction, and drama. These readings, from various historical periods and socio-cultural contexts, will be the basis for an exploration into the differences-often blurry and changeable-between "literary" and "non-literary" writing. At the same time, as we consider the uses, qualities, and effects of literature, we will examine, apply, and reflect upon a set of strategies for reading challenging creative works.

The first year of college is one of a number of big changes we negotiate in our lives. For many freshmen, the required composition course reminds us of other significant challenges we have coped with in more or less unconscious ways. Moving away from home to a new city—perhaps for the first time ever—stirs up all kinds of deep (even archetypal) feelings and stories: separating from family; moving into the unfamiliar intellectual and residential environment of a large urban university; learning new ways of traveling, handling money, taking care of oneself on one’s own; finding new cool friends who may or may not challenge our established ideas of who we are and where we come from; and starting a new life and lifestyle with a blank social slate.

The work of this seminar considers science fiction and its use of myth and religion in its narratives.  Mythology here is understood as a body of beliefs that seeks to answer questions about the relationship of humans to the divine. Science fiction expands our understanding of myth and religion and questions our relationship to technology and science as well.  Through a variety of readings and viewings, we will consider the way science fiction uses myth to complicate our understanding of the past, the present, and the future. Through essay writing, we will examine the language of speculative fiction, and how it provides a way to understand ourselves, our world and other worlds, and the universe and the univers-ity.  Because science fiction is so much a part of our experience in the 21st century, it provides a unique, metaphorical, and speculative language to engage with the expectations of college-level writing and to go beyond the structures of high school writing. You should have a strong interest in science fiction and mythology, a familiarity with religious traditions, and have a desire to boldly explore new worlds in reading and writing.

This is a discussion-based course, designed specifically for freshman, that poses a series of provocative questions which investigate the nature of urban places, including questions regarding race/class/culture, history and politics, planning and architecture, sustainability and environment, etc. Those questions will be asked through a sequence of reading/writing assignments and supplemented with regular experiential explorations of the city of Pittsburgh. We will consider the urban idea in its past, present, and future incarnations. Through individual and group research that combines the use of digital technology and physical interaction with our urban environment, we will develop and explore our interests and curiosities about cities. The result should be an opportunity to connect our academic community to the diverse communities around us and leave us understanding the city and our place within it in potentially novel and enlightening ways.

In this course, we will consider the ways that our memory and storytelling come together in different genres and styles in film. We will think about how media helps to shape our understanding of history and ourselves. In addition to reading critical articles, we will watch American and international films (such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Stories We Tell, After Life, and Badlands) to consider how we make narratives about our lives from our memories. This is a composition course with a film focus: in addition to our primary investment in writing, work-shopping and revising then, this class requires that students develop the vocabulary and skills to critically read films, literature, and theoretical texts.

In this Freshman Seminar, we will focus on what propaganda is, how it works, and why it's important to distinguish it from rhetorical persuasion. We will also analyze propaganda and learn to categorize it. Living in a time of opinionated media and claims of "fake news", we will discuss and write about propaganda. Our sources will include films, images, songs, and speeches from World War I, World War II, all the way up to the Iraq War and the 21st century. The term "propaganda" has Latin roots and means "to propagate" or "to sow." Some questions we'll ask (and hope to answer) in this seminar: What does propaganda want to sow into language and thought? What does it want to harvest? Are there different types of propaganda? Can a "good" propaganda exist? Along with writing essays, we will read the works by authors like Philip K. Dick, George Saunders, and George Orwell, and look at video games like BioShock and how they play with propaganda.

This course is required of all first-year ISP students. It is based on the ISP bi-weekly forum talks. A forum session typically consists of two research talks given by ISP faculty, ISP students, or guest speakers. Students enrolled are required to attend all but two forum sessions per term, and should attend all talks in a given session. Students are required to write a 1-page paper about each talk attended, stating what they found to be most interesting about the talk and why. The papers should be mailed to the course-coordinators within a week of the talk. Students should identify a topic of interest, related to at least one of the talks, and find an appropriate and willing ISP faculty member to be their project advisor. They should develop a project proposal, with input from their project advisor. Typically, a project should be a literature review or a well circumscribed pilot study. Proposals should be submitted to the course coordinators for their approval by the end of the term.

This course will deal with word structure and morphological processes in natural language (inflection, agreement, derivation, compounding, incorporation, cliticization, reduplication). The data to be analyzed will be drawn from a wide range of the world's languages. The relationship between morphology and other components of the grammar (syntax, phonology, the lexicon, pragmatics) will occupy a central place in the syllabus. Finally, considerations of typology, change, processing, and acquisition will be addressed. By and large, the approaches followed will be those of generative linguistics (Lexical Morphology, Prosodic Morphology, Distributed Morphology, etc.). The course presupposes a general linguistics course.

Korean 1 is the beginning course for those who have NO prior knowledge in Korean or who hear and speak Korean for the FIRST time. This course is designed for students to learn 'standard Korean', that is the spoken and written forms of Korean used by educated Koreans. This course is aimed for basic conversational fluency, to acquire reading skills and to learn grammatical structures and writing skills at the simple sentence level, and to learn basic listening comprehension. Topics such as greetings, talking about school and work, time and days of the week, daily life, past and future weekend activities will be covered throughout the course. Korean 1 classes are divided into two parts: Lecture classes will include important information and explanations of those conversational patterns in grammatical and pragmatic terms. The course also provides sociolinguistics and socio-cultural information especially when language is intimately linked with culture. Recitation classes will provide the students opportunity to practice strictly in Korean with various tasks and activities in most essential daily life situation. This means that students are expected to use the target language as much as they can throughout the course. Students will often be asked to make a pair or a small group in which they may interact with each other verbally. Students are expected to memorize the frame dialogues, vocabularies and expressions assigned by lesson with the help of CD-ROM in the Language Media Center (G17 CL) or on-line web site of the textbook and the workbook.

Western expansion was global.  It touched societies in East Asia, Latin America, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.  This class will compare moments of encounter between Western empires and non-Western societies from the perspective of the latter.  How did the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the Americas experience Western expansion?  Some of the answers can be found in the methodical work of the historian, in their choice of a research topic, survey of past research, collection of primary sources, development of a thesis, and writing of a paper.  This course will lead students each step of the way.  It will begin by introducing some of the major concepts that have shaped scholarship on the global experience of Western expansion.  It will then turn to writing a research paper, from the process of making an annotated outline of secondary sources, to collecting primary sources, outlining, writing, and revising a paper.  Once the draft is written, each student will present it to the class, both to receive feedback on it and to practice their presentation skills.  The final product will be your capstone essay.

Math 1230 will provide a capstone experience for undergraduate math or science students, especially those who have an interest in the history of math, the psychology of math learning, and/or in mathematics education. This course will concentrate on some of the Big Ideas of Mathematics from an historical perspective. It will demonstrate how the various strands of mathematics developed and are integrated; and how the characteristic thinking processes of mathematics (abstraction, axiomatization, proof etc) arose. It will give insight into how mathematicians create new mathematics and apply their discoveries to practical problems. It will examine how the available tools (number systems, sine and cosine tables, computers etc) have influenced the shape of mathematics.

Writing For The Public
3 cr.
W	
MoWe / 04:30 PM-05:45 PM / 00129CL


This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals; press kits; editorials; informational Web sites; articles; and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

How can we best communicate with others in order to persuade them? How can we promote a position or product while maintaining high ethical standards? Advertising and fundraising require the same kinds of persuasive work, though they serve different rhetorical contexts; advertising takes place in for-profit settings, while fundraising takes place in nonprofit settings. Both attempt to influence the decisions people make about the money they spend, the attitudes they have, and the issues that shape our society. In this course, students will analyze and create the kinds of persuasive writing used in the fields of fundraising and advertising. Coursework will involve readings, discussion, brief papers that analyze and critique work done in the fields, a presentation to the class, and an original written project that can become part of a student's portfolio to show prospective employers. Students will have opportunities to have their work reviewed in class, to participate in discussions with people currently working in the fields, and to revise their written pieces for a final portfolio.

This course will focus on the development of the modern detective novel, primarily British and American, from the late 19th century into the 21st.  Detective and crime fiction is one of the most popular forms of narrative, appealing to writers and readers with diverse interests and ideologies.  It can offer intense action, intellectual challenge, access to criminal underworlds, political and social critique, and exploration of the psyche.  Our approach will be broadly historical, from the amateur sleuths of Edgar Allan Poe and Conan Doyle, through the American “hard-boiled” private eye, to the “police procedural” and work by contemporary writers who push the genre in new directions, including television and film.  We will also examine the workings of gender, race, class and sexuality in detective fiction.

What role does technology, ethics and/or politics play in imagining our future? Why has science fiction become such a central metaphor for our daily, lived experiences? Introduction to Science Fiction discusses them all! This course is designed to expose students to broad spectrum of science fiction. We will examine representative texts from each of the modern, roughly defined as the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, “periods” of the genre. The class will discuss the ongoing debate surrounding the “work” performed by the genre, as well as its themes, and stylistic movements.

Since the 1920s, film production in the United States has been dominated by a powerful industry, manifested for several decades by a Hollywood "studio system" and subsequently by networks of economic corporate alliances. This course examines a wide variety of films that have been made using independent financing, outside the confines of this industry. The "indies" from Miramax and other studios will not be included. The films to be considered will be primarily a diverse sampling of independently produced narrative films, although a few examples of non-narrative experimental works (by, for instance, Maya Deren, Bruce Conner, Stan Brakhage, and Andy Warhol) and documentaries will be included as well. The course is structured more or less chronologically, beginning with a ca. 1920 classic by the African-American filmmaking pioneer Oscar Michaux. Attention will be given to late 1950s "Beat Generation" films like Pull My Daisy and John Cassavetese' first film, Shadows. Low-budget pioneers such as Roger Corman, Doris Wishman, Russ Meyer, John Waters and others will be considered, as will 1960s classics like Easy Rider and Medium Cool. Also included are key examples of blaxploitation and horror films from the late 1960s and the 1970s, including work by George Romero. Ethnic films such as Joan Micklin Silver's Hester Street (1975) and Wayne Wanga's Chan Is Missing (1982) will also be examined, and the course will conclude with several key directors who emerged from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, such as John Sayles, David Lynch, Susan Seidelman, Jim Jarmusch, and Steven Soderbergh.

What is art?  This introductory course, designed for students with no previous background in art or art history, is intended to probe this question – and challenge traditional assumptions -- while providing students with the skills to interpret works of art and architecture from a diversity of world cultures.  The course is designed to demonstrate some of the basic tools of analysis with which to approach works of art as material and aesthetic objects while also examining them as productions that negotiate with historical and cultural contexts.  The course also thinks pointedly about cultural difference and the ways in which art has been employed to define communities as radically particular while also answering basic human needs that connect people living in different times and places.

As the introductory design studio in the Architectural Studies Design Track, this course explores fundamental design concepts that are essential in the process of creating architecture. Through a series of interrelated projects, students will be introduced to the primary modes of architectural communication i.e. writing, photography, sketching, diagramming, drafting and model making. Understanding these devices not only as tools for presentation but as means of exploration, students will work through conceptual exercises that investigate both qualitative and quantitative characteristics that define the Atmosphere of architectural space. This design studio will challenge students to develop an understanding of architecture as a procedural practice where the design solution is not a preconceived notion, but evolves through exploration and experimentation.

Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

One of the most familiar, but least understood, groups in American history are the Puritans who settled New England in the 17th century.  This course introduces students to the ways historians work by allowing them to address key questions regarding the unique identity of the New England Puritans. Students will be encouraged to develop their own assessment of the Puritan social, political, economic and religious legacy.  Due to their intellectual sophistication and commitment to creating a godly society in the North American wilderness, New England’s Puritans were almost constantly engaged in theological, social, political and economic controversies. These controversies, their commitment to scripture, and their high level of literacy, created a substantial paper trail.  Due to both their stature in American history, and this wealth of documentation, the Puritan legacy has been hotly contested since the earliest generation of American historians.  Through primary documents and secondary literature students will analyze not only the nature of Puritan New England, but also how it has been perceived by various generations of historians.  Students will become part of this historical debate by writing several short analytical papers using primary and secondary documents and discussing their findings in class discussions and debates.

In this course we discuss the American (US) Criminal Justice System, Drinking on US College Campuses, and Hip Hop music. We introduce fundamental, core sociological concepts in examining these three micro- areas of study. Beyond that we bridge the three thematic areas in subtle ways that weave our sociological analysis with depth and by introducing cross-cultural links. This globalization component is a powerful example of how connected our world is. The format utilizes lectures, recitations, and assignments.

This course is an examination of a broad  range of social theorists, whose ideas have influenced sociology.  We will read selections of some of the major works of both classical (principally Marx, Weber and Durkheim) and contemporary theorists with the goal of understanding and critically assessing their leading ideas.  Part of this effort will be the task of understanding how the ideas of these thinkers arose in specific social and cultural contexts (i.e., what social problems they thought they were addressing) and in specific intellectual traditions (i.e., what preceding ideas they were borrowing from and bending to their purposes).  The course readings and lecture discussions will also emphasize the continuing relevance of these ideas by examining how they are used (in various modified forms) in some current examples of sociological research.

Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

The independent study option permits students in good academic standing to design Public and Professional Writing (PPW) courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. The independent study must integrate both the theory and practice of some aspect of public and/or professional writing, and the student must conduct research that will allow him or her to contextualize the writing forms and content being studied. Students typically write at least 30 pages (or 7,500 words) over the course of the term, and revision plays a significant role in the student's work. In addition, the student and sponsoring faculty member define a reading list and other required research, which may include interviews or surveys. The student and faculty member will agree on other work, such as essays or documents and a journal or other response to the research. Whenever possible, the student will create a final document that can be used by an intended audience or in a professional portfolio. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is comfortable with the subject matter of the study and has worked with the student in the past. The specific form for requesting this faculty approval can be obtained from the Director or Associate Director of PPW in M-2 Thaw Hall. The form requires a description of the project you are proposing, what you expect to learn from it, the reading and research you will do, the products you will create as a result of your study, and the ways in which your sponsor will engage with your work. You should expect to meet with your sponsor at least eight times during the term. Please note that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

In this course, we will explore the question, “How do you write about what you cannot see?” We will examine how the spiritual life—an inner dimension of life that has to do with our relationship with our own selves and/or the divine—is represented in writing while exploring the following inquiries: How do authors write about spiritual experiences/beliefs/questions/doubts that others cannot see? How do they push beyond religious rhetoric to convey their inner lives in language that others can understand? How can you write clearly and creatively about your own faith or skepticism? To investigate these questions and more, we will read writers from various disciplines (including neuroscience) and religions, visit several religious landmarks in the city of Pittsburgh, and write a series of essays designed to embody spirituality. This course welcomes students who want to use writing to explore their own spiritual lives and learn about the spiritual lives of others. Writing the Spiritual also includes an introduction to mindfulness meditation.

This course is only for Sociology majors who will be writing an honors thesis. Before registering for this course, the prospective student must get the permission of the departmental Undergraduate advisor. The main purpose of the honors seminar is to help honors students conceive, plan, execute, and write an honors thesis.  An honors thesis is a report of original scholarly research conducted by an honors student under the supervision of a faculty member.  During the fall semester, students will choose a research topic, identify a faculty member who will serve as their thesis advisor, find an appropriate research setting, and gather the bulk of the research data. During the subsequent spring semester, students will work directly with their thesis advisor to complete the data collection and analysis, complete a first draft of the thesis, revise the thesis according to feedback from the advisor, and finalize the thesis.

In this course students will continue to develop oral proficiency in French through engaging in conversation, providing and obtaining information, and exchanging opinions. Students present informally during debates and sketches as well as more formally through oral exposes and digitally recorded oral samples. Understanding of the cultural implications of written and visual texts is enhanced through exposure to current news stories and films.

GER 0004 is intended to follow GER 0003. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. Students will write compositions of increasing complexity, and continue reading longer and more difficult texts, including a simplified version of a German novel. They will also work with web materials, complete a variety of assignments online, and work on a group project. Together with GER 0003, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

Edelman,Barbara Jane

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

This course is for students who have successfully completed German 0002 or who have placed into the course on the basis of the department placement test. German 0003 will provide students with opportunities to strengthen their listening and speaking abilities and mastery of German grammar, to read a variety of short authentic texts as well as a longer adapted book, and to write longer and more complex compositions than those assigned in Elementary German courses. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. They will also work with web materials, complete a variety of assignments online, and work on a project. Together with GER 0004, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

The course will provide students with elementary logic skills and an understanding of scientific arguments.  Ours is an increasingly scientific and technical society.  In both our personal life decisions and in our work we are daily confronted by scientific results which influence what we do and how we do it.  Basic skills in analyzing the structure of arguments in terms of truth and evidence are required to make this type of information accessible and useful.  We hear, for example, that drinking alcoholic beverages reduces the chances of heart disease.  We might well ask what sorts of tests were done to reach this conclusion and do the tests really justify the claim?  We read that certain geographical configurations in South America "prove" that this planet was visited by aliens from outer space.  Does this argument differ from other, accepted scientific arguments?  This course is designed to aid the student in making sense of a variety of elementary logic skills in conjunction with the application of those skills to actual cases.

This will be a course designed to increase students' knowledge and understanding of emerging field of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology deals with materials in nanometer scales, typically one to 100 nanometers. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter; approximately the length of five silicon atoms placed side-by-side or the width of a single strand of DNA. On nanometer scale, materials may possess new physical properties or exhibit new physical phenomena. For example, band gaps of semiconductors can be effectively tuned by adjusting their nano-dimensions. For nanomaterials, number of surface atoms becomes a significant fraction of the total number of atoms and the surface energy starts to dominate. This changes thermal stability and catalytic properties of many materials as we know them. During the course, the students will gain a sound appreciation of different techniques and instruments involved in the preparation and characterization of nanomaterials. Current and future applications of nanomaterials in medicine, defense, energy production, and computation will be also discussed.

Because this is an international relations capstone course, special attention will be paid to the ways in which international context and international (and transnational) actors affect conflict within countries.  Our focus will be on developing generalizable theory and identifying empirical patterns that are broadly applicable to civil wars across time and space.  That said, we also will explore the relevance of these theories and findings to current and recent civil wars.

This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals; press kits; editorials; informational Web sites; articles; and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

How can we best communicate with others in order to persuade them? How can we promote a position or product while maintaining high ethical standards? Advertising and fundraising require the same kinds of persuasive work, though they serve different rhetorical contexts; advertising takes place in for-profit settings, while fundraising takes place in nonprofit settings. Both attempt to influence the decisions people make about the money they spend, the attitudes they have, and the issues that shape our society. In this course, students will analyze and create the kinds of persuasive writing used in the fields of fundraising and advertising. Coursework will involve readings, discussion, brief papers that analyze and critique work done in the fields, a presentation to the class, and an original written project that can become part of a student's portfolio to show prospective employers. Students will have opportunities to have their work reviewed in class, to participate in discussions with people currently working in the fields, and to revise their written pieces for a final portfolio.

Bamyeh, Mohammed

The aim of this course is to introduce students to the broad spectrum of histories, theories, and current realities of global life. This includes looking at interconnections in social, economic, political, and cultural life across various societies. Today's globalization is approached as a process with deep roots in the comparative history of civilizations. Parallels to contemporary processes of globalization can be seen in the spread of trade routes, world religions, common languages, habits, manners, fashions, lifestyles, ideas and ideologies. These have foundations in migrations, conquests, world systems, discoveries, travels, and economic networks no less profound in the past than in the present. Students who are genuinely interested in the topic will learn a lot from this course; those who are not will find it difficult."

This course is a historical introduction to the religious traditions that developed in ancient Near East and the Mediterranean. Our major emphasis is on the history of the religious traditions that emerged in late antiquity in this area and which continue to be major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Zoroastrianism. We focus on key concepts, historical developments, and contemporary issues. Throughout the course, we also examine interactions among these religious traditions. In the last part of the course we examine the issue of globalization and the spread of these religions around the world as well as the presence of "non-Western" religion in the "West." The course also serves as an introduction to the academic study of religion and provides a foundation for further coursework in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. No prior knowledge of any of the religions studied is expected or assumed.

This course is a survey of major movements in literary theory and cultural criticism. It will introduce students to key texts of the 20th and 21st centuries that shaped and revolutionized strategies for reading and interpreting texts, films, and other cultural objects. The course will expand student familiarity with movements beginning with New Criticism and Russian Formalism, move through Structuralism and Post-Structuralism, explore Feminist, Queer, and Critical Race Theory, and take on post-colonial, orientalist, and transnational approaches--among others. Students in this course will read a variety of literature and theory with an eye toward understanding what criticism's roles are, why and how the study of literature and culture (still) matters, and how they can develop their own critical skills based on their personal interests and concerns. This course will also offer an introduction to bibliography and research methods. It will further offer grad students an opportunity to hone their presentation and writing skills. The course and readings will be in English.

The Independent Study option permits students to design courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department literature courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

Students are taught a variety of strategies to develop extensive and intensive reading skills, contextualized guessing of vocabulary, skimming/scanning, and gisting (i.e., reading for the main ideas). Some assignments lead students through large blocks of text, while others concentrate on shorter segments by emphasizing lexical and grammatical details. It is intended as a vehicle to help participants make a successful transition from language courses to advanced literature/culture courses at the 1200-level which are taught in German. Course assignments are built around a collection of literary texts from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries.

Operations Management (OM) refers to management of operations of an organization. Operations entail the process of transformation of inputs into outputs using technical, human, and financial resources. For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

Operations Management (OM) refers to management of operations of an organization. Operations entail the process of transformation of inputs into outputs using technical, human, and financial resources. For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

Attention will also be paid to the construction of criteria for firm success that reflect the complex interactions of ethical, societal, legal, and economic demands. Considerable time will be devoted to the study and analysis of companies.

This course is designed to examine the history of organized crime not only within the United States, but from an International perspective as well. The emergence of "non-traditional" groups which are competing for power and profits will be examined, as well as the alliances between various criminal groups that have evolved, resulting in the phenomenon of "transnational" organized crime. Those "non-traditional" groups include, but are not necessarily limited to, domestic and international terrorist organizations, the reasons for their development as well as the perceived risk to American citizens both in a domestic environment and abroad. Neither organized crime nor a terrorist organization can be effectively discussed without integrating the evolution of U.S. Drug Policy, which will be included. Finally, the various government tactics implemented to counter the threats mentioned herein as well as the impact on the private sector will be integrated into lectures throughout the program.

Stresses analogies between the three modes of transport phenomena; momentum, mass, and heat transport.  Covers from the molecular origins of transport up through continuum descriptions, as well as macroscopic balances.  Reynolds and Colburn Analogies in Boundary-Layer Flow as well as direct comparison of linear transport relations, such as fluid drag and mass/heat convection will be a primary focus. Problems ranging from (traditional) packed bed reactors to micro-fluidics or micro-electromechanical systems will also be discussed.

This course combines elements of mass and energy balances, thermodynamics, separations, and product design in order to set the foundation for the remainder of the chemical engineering curriculum.  This course introduces chemical engineering problem solving techniques from both a (traditional) process-centric viewpoint as well as a product centric viewpoint.  The course will span from theoretical (basic thermodynamics) to applied (separations) allowing a simple route to problem-based learning of difficult theoretical concepts.

Engel,Rafael

Since the inception of Elizabethan Poor Laws, societies, governments, and charitable organizations have struggled with the welfare paradox. In 1601, for the first time, a government acknowledged the need for a macro-secular effort for assigning the burgeoning populations of the poor, as charities, often with religious overtones, proved unequal to the task. This course focuses on the underlying assumptions of programs designed to assist and evaluate the poor, reviewing the similarities and distinctions of various programs, always addressing their effectiveness and their ability to ameliorate the conditions of their targeted populations. In particular, focus is on Colonial America, the Civil War era, the dawn and evolution of America into the industrial age, and early programs of the New Deal.

Jones,Toya S.

The Introduction to Social Work course provides an overview of professional social work. It examines the historical development of the profession of social work; introduces the profession's values, ethics, and practice principles; examines the major interventive methods of social work practice; identifies the generalist base of social work practice; and explores the social service delivery networks which comprise the social welfare system in urban environments. Social work's historic commitment to social justice and to the elimination of poverty is integrated throughout the course. The course format includes lecture presentations-discussions; guest presentations; reading assignments; examinations; student volunteer service; and visits to social agencies.

This course introduces students to the art of the cinema, and to the techniques for its formal and iconographic analysis. It examines the nature of shot composition and visual framing, the use of color, the role of lighting as a pictorial element, the potentials of camera movement, the modes of editing and the nature of image/sound montage. It also introduces students to dominant cinema forms--narrative, experimental, documentary, etc.--and connects the cinema to visual arts (like painting and sculpture).

1. This capstone course designed for senior Film Studies majors focuses on two critical practices that are usually perceived as entirely separate today:  film theory and film criticism.  Film theory is the province of academic scholars who publish their research in specialized journals and books distributed by university presses.  Film criticism belongs to writers who publish in more mainstream newspapers and magazines, as well as on the Internet.  While film theorists and film critics are sometimes interested in the same films, they are conventionally described as interested in very different readers:  film theorists write for professionally trained students and scholars of cinema, while film critics write for everyday people seeking guidance about where to direct their passion for movies. But what happens when we study film theory and film criticism alongside each other?  Are there similarities that emerge beside the differences?  What can film criticism learn from film theory?  And film theory from film criticism?  What can we learn about the nature of cinema from the convergences and divergences between film criticism and film theory?  Demanding, critically complex readings in film theory and film criticism will open up our discussion of such questions, and students will pose (and answer) questions of their own in essays, presentations, and weekly journals.  We will survey a broad range of films, from the silent era to the present.

Sex, Law And Marriage
3 cr.
	
Fr / 12:00 PM-02:25 PM / 05201WWPH
Defazio,David J

This course will survey the socio-legal aspects of marriage, marital alternatives and related modes of sexual expression.  In many respects, the law in these areas has been changing dramatically, reflecting, if not causing, fundamental shifts in the values and norms surrounding intimate behavior.  All of the major changes will be examined in this course, and topics such as the following will be covered:  ceremonialized marriage, common law marriage, open marriage, contract marriage, homosexual and transsexual marriage, divorce (including "no-fault"), adultery, marital sodomy, marital rape, artificial insemination, test tube fertilization, abortion, illegitimacy, adoption, paternity suits, child custody, alimony and property settlements.

This course examines the mythology of adultery. Accordingly, it begins with the major European myth of adultery -- The Romance of Tristan and Iseult. Our primary focus, however, will fall on the screen adaptations of four nineteenth-century novels of adultery: Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Tolstoi's Anna Karenina, and Fontane's Effi Briest. In the corpus of films, we will distinguish between novel- and myth-oriented adaptations. Additionally, we will "read" and analyze graphic novels (comic books) based on these literary sources. Integrated into the course as cultural products of equal value, the verbal and visual texts will allow us to realize that the novels of adultery on a par with their celluloid and graphic-novel versions constitute the multi-faceted construct resting on the adultery myth. Exploring metamorphoses that the myth undergoes from one text to another will enable us to better understand the roots of the modern notion of adultery. Also, we will investigate the factors that transformed the novel Anna Karenina into the all-encompassing and the most influential narrative of adultery today.

This course will focus on the construction of girlhood—as it takes shape in children’s literature, in educational and advice books, in periodicals and other media, and in texts that articulate the status of females and children. We’ll consider emerging distinctions about girlhood in English and American texts from the 18th and 19th -centuries. We’ll then move to the present, exploring how girlhood persists as a gendered category in today’s media, in cultural and educational institutions. How are girls positioned in relationship to boys or to women? How are girls constructed as readers, viewers, bodies, students, agents, consumers? Students will have a chance to work with rich collections of archival materials (for example,  19th-century literacy books for children, children’s periodicals and literature, advice books). We will explore how contemporary scholarship, media, books, and images challenge (or perpetuate) this complex history.  This course should be of particular interest to those preparing to teach or work with girls, or those with interest in children’s literature or gender studies.

This course explores the related activities of reading poetry and writing responsively to the forms, ideas, and meanings we find therein. We will read poems from various moments in history, including poems from our contemporary culture. Our work will be guided by the following questions: What differentiates poetry from other uses of language? How is it that one poem can carry so many "meanings"? What might poetry be good for in a culture such as ours?

In today's marketplace, proposals produce billions of dollars to help solve problems and support causes that people care about. Grant proposals make possible important research in the natural, behavioral, and social sciences; they enable many to benefit from civic and educational projects; and they benefit community development and fund artistic achievement. Other types of proposals allow people to start businesses, create change on the job, and define projects that meet the needs of particular audiences. This course will allow students to understand the functions and conventions of proposals, the types of research that they require, and the processes that generate them and lead to approval. Students will focus on two main issues: developing a proposal (which includes activities such as defining needs, reviewing existing projects and literature, and, if seeking a grant, researching sources of funds) and writing a proposal with a specific audience in mind. Coursework will help students develop an understanding of proposal writing from an initial idea through final submission. Students will complete a variety of written pieces leading up to the final proposal, which may be valuable in their employment portfolios. Upon completion of this course, students will have acquired the research and writing skills necessary to write successful proposals.

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

Why do financial crises occur so often? And what are their consequences? Combining insights from political science and economics, we will examine why our policymakers and our institutions often fail to make the economy crisis-proof. In addition, we will examine what the consequences of these crises are at the macro (country) and the micro (individual) levels. Finally, we will think of ways in which good reforms could be implemented.

This is a self-contained course for students not majoring in the physical sciences. Lectures mainly deal with astronomical objects that lie outside the solar system. The properties of stars and processes in them are examined, including a discussion of the birth, evolution, and death of stars, and the formation of pulsars and black holes. On a much larger scale the properties and formation of galaxies and active galaxies, including exotic objects such as quasars, are discussed. Finally, the subject of cosmology and the origin and ultimate fate of the Universe are considered. Part of this course includes the requirement of one evening "field trip" to the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory. The purpose of these trips will be to tour the facility and, if possible, make observation with a telescope. On any one evening only a small fraction of the class will make a trip, so it should be possible to accommodate the students' evening schedules. A small percentage of the course grade will be based on participation in these field trips.

This section of the Short Story will be devoted to the readings from 19th and 20th Century Russian literature. We will spend a good portion of our class sessions discussing the readings. The authors we will read range from 19th century favorites--Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov--to 20th century masters--Babel, Zamiatin, and Zoshchenko--right up to the most popular writers in Russia today--from Solzhenitsyn to Petrushevskaya and Tolstaya. Russians have always valued the short story as a source of wisdom and knowledge as well as entertainment and aesthetic pleasure, as a resource for understanding themselves as individuals in a complex society, as a means for analyzing social behavior and psychological relationships, and as a place for airing cultural issues and matters of political and social concern. As we read and discuss these stories, we will be asking shy these authors selected the short story rather than poetry, the novel, or drama for their inventions and fantasies, philosophies, and teachings, and why and how they expressed their views and values as they did using particular forms of language, imagery, and narrative structures. We will compare Russian and American ideas and values, considering both our cultural similarities and differences. We will both discuss the shared themes expressed in these stories and try to identify their particular national stereotypes and peculiar "Russian" characteristics. We will examine common and uncommon emotions and passions, customs, and mores, beliefs, fantasies, and dreams. Finally, we will attempt to draw conclusions about our own values, feelings, assumptions, reactions, and prejudices and their sources as we respond to the expressions of issues and problems raised in the short story literature of a different and fascinating culture.

This is the third of a three-term sequence that aims to develop skills and areas of competence acquired in ITAL 0001 and 0002, while teaching students to produce more authentic and more accurate Italian speech, comprehend more sophisticated structures in written and oral form, and broaden their understanding of contemporary Italian culture and society. Instructors incorporate a variety of texts (authentic written materials, songs, film, short stories) to present contemporary Italian culture. Students' progress is evaluated through oral and written exams, homework assignments, participation in class, and portfolio assignments.

Sepac, Jason

“The Steel City,” “The City of Bridges,” “The City of Champions,” “The Paris of Appalachia,” and my personal favorite, “Hell with the Lid Off.” All have been names that refer to the city that many of you will call home for the next 4 years. To outsiders and perhaps locals as well, Pittsburgh can be a difficult city to navigate – geographically and rhetorically. Yes, we talk funny (Yinz’ll know what I mean soon enough), but as a city that somehow manages to simultaneously attract and resist every label that comes along, it also makes it a fun and challenging place to write about. In this course, we will deal with these challenges by exploring and writing critically about various representations of Pittsburgh through fiction, non-fiction, historical documents, photographs, and film. In addition to reading about the city, this course will require you to spend a significant amount of time exploring and critically analyzing its neighborhoods. Getting around the city is not unlike writing about the city: In the distance, you can see where you want to go, but often the roads are obscured by the hills, valleys, and rivers that divide it. Along the way, though, you may find something unexpected - a new perspective, a new idea, a new home - a new way of writing Pittsburgh.

This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of organic chemistry through the study of structural principles, reaction mechanisms, and synthesis. The basic goals of the course are to develop appreciation and skill in the methods of molecular analysis which have made organic chemistry such a powerful intellectual discipline. Topics covered will include conformational analysis of alkanes, stereochemistry and various reactions of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and conjugated systems. The course will prepare the student for work in advanced topics in organic chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering and the health related sciences.

This course surveys the music of Western Europe from Ancient Greece to 1750. We will accomplish this through reading, listening,formal analysis, and, when possible, performance. Students will place the music within the culture of the time by examining art works, architecture,political,religious, and cultural institutions, and literature. We will examine and analyze scores of representative works, including troubadour songs, liturgical chant, early polyphony, madrigals, opera, orchestral and chamber music, and music for keyboard. NOTES: (1) This course meets the 2nd level Music/Art Requirement, (2) This course is part of the core requirement in music history and theory for music majors and normally should be taken concurrently with music 0417 (Theory 3).

As the introductory design studio in the Architectural Studies Design Track, this course explores fundamental design concepts that are essential in the process of creating architecture. Through a series of interrelated projects, students will be introduced to the primary modes of architectural communication i.e. writing, photography, sketching, diagramming, drafting and model making. Understanding these devices not only as tools for presentation but as means of exploration, students will work through conceptual exercises that investigate both qualitative and quantitative characteristics that define the Atmosphere of architectural space. This design studio will challenge students to develop an understanding of architecture as a procedural practice where the design solution is not a preconceived notion, but evolves through exploration and experimentation.

This will be a course designed to increase students' knowledge and understanding of emerging field of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology deals with materials in nanometer scales, typically one to 100 nanometers. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter; approximately the length of five silicon atoms placed side-by-side or the width of a single strand of DNA. On nanometer scale, materials may possess new physical properties or exhibit new physical phenomena. For example, band gaps of semiconductors can be effectively tuned by adjusting their nano-dimensions. For nanomaterials, number of surface atoms becomes a significant fraction of the total number of atoms and the surface energy starts to dominate. This changes thermal stability and catalytic properties of many materials as we know them. During the course, the students will gain a sound appreciation of different techniques and instruments involved in the preparation and characterization of nanomaterials. Current and future applications of nanomaterials in medicine, defense, energy production, and computation will be also discussed.

Slemmons,Rebecca M

Visual Thinking is an introduction into the process and practice of making images. The broad scope of the subject is explored through lectures, discussions and critiques. Students are introduced to the dynamics of composition, relationships of form and content, principles of color, aesthetics, visual analysis, perception, and the importance of visual choice, purpose, and creativity in an increasingly image-oriented culture. The course also seeks to provide some experience with a variety of media, develop skills in observation and technique, and encourage personal involvement in solving visual problems. Projects focus on preparation and planning, developing awareness of visual issues, understanding and applying visual concepts, and developing core skills and technique. The course offers a relevant introduction and insight into the process and practice of making art. This course is open to art majors and non-art majors. In-class productivity and participation, as well as significant out-of-class work are expected. The course requires the purchase of art materials and supplies. Due to the nature of studio practice, demonstration, and performance, it is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting. There is a $15.00 lab fee.

Political Sociology is centrally concerned with the nature and role of the state, and politics, in general.  This includes a focus on the social basis of power and the political phenomena and consequences thereof.  This course will provide a systematic overview of political sociology, including: the origins and development of the state, the nature and sources of power in our contemporary world, the relationships between class and state, class conflict and class politics, race and gender politics, the mechanisms of political control and domination, political organization, the politics of social movements, the nature and dynamics of nationalism and ethnic conflict, and a wide range of other topics related to politics and society.  In this regard, we will approach the topic through political economy lenses, respecting comparative and historical dimensions down through the present day.

Foundations in Art History offers an introduction to the history of the art historical discipline and its research and interpretive methods. Other courses in the art history department introduce students to the 'what' of art history--major works and histories of the arts in specific time periods and geographic locations around the globe. This course, by contrast, is devoted to the 'how' of what the art historian does--how she or he interprets the work of art according to its specific characteristics, the place and time period in which the artwork was created, and the changing nature of viewers' responses to it.

Petrak,Jozef M and Ghildyal,Utkarsh Suresh

This course introduces a fundamental approach to architectural design. Through a continuous sequence of design projects, students will learn to develop a set of principles that inform/dictate the production of architecture. These principles will be used to clarify the interrelationship of geometry, form, and composition, thus defining a systematic strategy for an architectural solution. Additionally, various methodologies, including case study analysis, site analysis, analytical diagramming, and strategic programming, will be taught in order to further inform this solution. The design principles, in coordination with the methodologies, will allow students develop an understanding of the complex relationship between design practice and architectural discourse. Finally, a range of drawing and model-making skills will be introduced as a means of seeing, understanding and presenting. A student taking this course will earn 6 credits. The pre-requisite for this course is Design Studio 1.

Foundations Of Welfare State

Since the inception of Elizabethan Poor Laws, societies, governments, and charitable organizations have struggled with the welfare paradox. In 1601, for the first time, a government acknowledged the need for a macro-secular effort for assigning the burgeoning populations of the poor, as charities, often with religious overtones, proved unequal to the task. This course focuses on the underlying assumptions of programs designed to assist and evaluate the poor, reviewing the similarities and distinctions of various programs, always addressing their effectiveness and their ability to ameliorate the conditions of their targeted populations. In particular, focus is on Colonial America, the Civil War era, the dawn and evolution of America into the industrial age, and early programs of the New Deal.

This is a standard introductory course in microeconomics. It focuses on the way the market system works. The decisions of households, firms, and governments are coordinated through markets in which prices adjust to keep buying plans and selling plans consistent. The U.S. economy relies mainly on markets to coordinate these decisions, although sometimes governments intervene. We will explore various social issues using the principles developed throughout the course. Upon completion of the course students will have a better understanding of economic problems, efficiency, laws of demand and supply, consumer choice theory, market organization, production and cost.

One of the most celebrated periods of U.S. history, the Civil Rights Movement has been the subject of countless books, memoirs, and films. These narratives, however, have privileged certain individuals and interpretations over others. This course challenges some of the myths, misrepresentations, and omissions in mainstream representations of the movement. While we will examine the significant contributions of key figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X, the course will also uncover many of the lesser-known individuals who confronted racial discrimination and fought to secure civil and human rights for black people in the United States. Beginning in the 1940s and moving through the 1970s, the course explores several key areas of inquiry including the role of religion, gender, class and sexuality in shaping the movement; the significance of international historical developments; the growth of freedom struggles in the urban North; and the use of armed resistance in the movement.

This course is a historical introduction to the religious traditions that developed in ancient Near East and the Mediterranean. Our major emphasis is on the history of the religious traditions that emerged in late antiquity in this area and which continue to be major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Zoroastrianism. We focus on key concepts, historical developments, and contemporary issues. Throughout the course, we also examine interactions among these religious traditions. In the last part of the course we examine the issue of globalization and the spread of these religions around the world as well as the presence of "non-Western" religion in the "West." The course also serves as an introduction to the academic study of religion and provides a foundation for further coursework in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. No prior knowledge of any of the religions studied is expected or assumed.

Like other Seminars in Composition, this introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. This particular seminar will include a series of films, along with discussions that focus on how film and other media shape the ways we view and understand the world. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, the course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing and film.

The aim of this course is to provide a broad survey of some fundamental questions in philosophy of science, and to cultivate your ability to think through these difficult questions in a clear and critical way. The course is divided in three main parts. In the first part, we explore the questions: "What is science? Is there a valid scientific method?" We tackle these questions by looking at the problem of induction, some classic answers to it, and following developments in confirmation theory. In part two, we investigate the questions: "Is science aiming at truth? Or does it only aim at saving the phenomena?" We critically assess three main philosophical views surrounding this issue. Finally, in part three, we concentrate on more specific questions such as: "What is a scientific explanation?", and "What is a law of nature?" We look, once again, at both traditional answers and more recent attempts to answer those challenging questions.

The American Dream is an elusive concept which has meant many different things to many different people since humans started settling in the regions now collectively known as the United States.  The term itself became popular in the early 20th century.  To some, this “dream” represented economic opportunity; to others it symbolized social mobility or political liberty or religious freedom or other at-times hard-to-define principles.  This seminar will investigate various constructions of the American Dream—who was invested in realizing that dream, how did they construe it, and what limitations might have prevented their access to it?  The class will employ primary sources, literary articulations of the American Dream, and scholarly work that has addressed the concept throughout U.S. history.  Seminar participants will research and write a substantial essay focusing on one discrete aspect of this phenomenon.

Teaching French, Italian, and German [for beginning TAs] /Advanced Topics in Foreign Language Learning and Teaching [for advanced TAs] This course supports the concept that instructional expertise is developed in and through teaching. Using a modified "lesson study model" of teacher development, new and experienced foreign language instructors will work together to identify problems of practice, discuss the theory and instructional practices that address these pedagogical concerns, and collaboratively develop a lesson to be taught by a member of the class and later analyzed and refined by the class as a whole. Videotapes of these lessons will be used as the primary source of information for analysis, discussion, and reflection. Four major areas will ground our work: 1) designing lessons to promote a language learning community, 2) teaching culture through language, and language through culture, 3) advancing oral language proficiency, and 4) developing literacy in a foreign language. Assignments include participation in collaborative lesson plan development, reflective reports on videotapes of classroom instruction, written analysis of tutorial work with language learners, and a culminating project developed in stages throughout the course that unifies the four themes in a statement of teaching philosophy. Not language specific, this course is intended for current and future teachers in the modern foreign languages.

The topics for the course include (a) survey of types of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and algae; (b) types of methods used to culture and study these microorganisms, especially bacteria, including aseptic technique; preparation of microbiological culture media; isolation of bacteria from natural source,  and cultivation of various types of microbes; use of microscopes and basic staining techniques; identification of unknown bacterial isolates; and (c) some practical applications of microbiology such as microbiological analysis of wastewater, and identification of clinical isolates. The exercises incorporate practice with (i) data analysis, (ii) commonly used computational skills needed by microbiologists, and (iii) safety practices for protecting the microbiologist, personnel on whom the laboratory depends (e.g. custodian and dishwasher), and the workspace, from microbial contamination. The curriculum includes a variety of standard methods that anyone having such a course listed on his or her transcript would be expected to know. There is a lab fee attached to this course.

Lederman, Harvey

TO BE OFFERED EVERY SEMESTER. SEMINAR ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY FOR POST-COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION STUDENTS IN RESIDENCE IN PITTSBURGH. SEMINAR REGISTRATION WILL BE MANDATORY ONLY FOR POST-COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION STUDENTS NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER FOR FTDA. FORMAT: EACH WEEK, A STUDENT PRESENTS SOME OF HIS OR HER WORK IN PROGRESS, E.G. A DISSERTATION CHAPTER, PREFERABLY TO BE CIRCULATED IN ADVANCE. THE SEMINAR WILL BE TAKEN UP WITH DISCUSSION OF THE WORK. OTHER DETAILS OF ITS FORMAT (SUCH AS WHETHER ALL MANDATED ATTENDEES MUST PRESENT WORK IN PROGRESS OR ONLY THOSE ALREADY ADMITTED TO CANDIDACY) WILL BE DETERMINED EACH SEMESTER BY THE INSTRUCTOR. THE PURPOSES OF THIS SEMINAR (WHICH HAS VERY SUCCESSFUL COUNTERPARTS AT OTHER TOP GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN PHILOSOPHY) ARE MULTIFOLD. IT GIVES STUDENTS WORKING ON DISSERTATION PROJECTS A COMMUNITY OF OTHERS IN THE SAME BOAT. IT PROVIDES THEM WITH FEEDBACK ON WORK IN PROGRESS, AND PRACTICE PRESENTING THEIR WORK TO AN AUDIENCE WIDER THAN THEIR COMMITTEE. (THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE IMPRESSION THEY MAKE ON THE JOB MARKET.) SUPPOSING THAT EACH STUDENT ADMITTED TO CANDIDACY MAKES A SEMINAR PRESENTATION EACH SEMESTER, IT HASTENS TIME TO COMPLETION BY IMPOSING INTERIM DEADLINES ON THE ROAD TO A COMPLETED DISSERTATION. THE SEMINAR GIVES STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY EVALUATED BUT NOT YET DEFENDED A PROSPECTUS EXAMPLES OF OTHER STUDENTS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED THE TRANSITION.

An academic internship offers students a unique learning opportunity to connect classroom knowledge with real-world settings as they explore careers and gain valuable experience. Students may earn from 1-3 credits for an experience that can be related to an academic field of study. The experience must be pre-professional in nature and must be approved by the A&S Office of Experiential Learning. Students must seek out and apply for their own internship. To look for internships, log into the Pitt Portal ("http://www.my.pitt.edu"www.my.pitt.edu), go to Career Services, then visit FutureLinks, or contact the OEL. Students who are earning credit for ARTSC 1900 internships may not receive pay. Students must work at least 120 hours over the course of the term to be eligible for the maximum of 3 credits. In order to earn credit, the student must have an A&S faculty sponsor (full-time only) who will assign related academic work. Internships are graded as S/NC. Students must submit a completed Learning Agreement form to A&S Office of Experiential Learning (B4 Thaw Hall) for approval and receive a special permission form to register for internship credit(s). Students may obtain a Learning Agreement form and more information from the A&S Office of Experiential Learning in B4 Thaw Hall or from "http://www.pitt.edu/~intern"www.pitt.edu/~intern It is expected that students will register for ARTSC 1900 during the specified Registration or Add/Drop periods.

MoWeFr / 11:00 AM-11:50 AM / 00316OEH


This "W" course is an introduction to the theoretical treatment of the real numbers, sets, functions, sequences, and limits. Classwork and homework will concentrate on the writing and understanding of proofs of theorems centered on these topics. For most students, the techniques of reading and doing proofs will be new. Two recitations per week, therefore, are required to practice this skill as well as to rehearse the many definitions of mathematical concepts in the course. It is required for all Mathematics and Statistics majors except for Departmental Honors majors who may wish to accelerate by substituting Mathematics 0450 for 0413 and 0420, and then taking Advanced Calculus. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

Rao,Sandhya M

The Physics and Astronomy Colloquium, held jointly with the Carnegie Mellon University Physics Department, provides an opportunity for all faculty and students to hear invited lectures and discuss problems of current interest to members of the Physics and Astronomy Department. The talks are intended for faculty and students from all areas, and thereby constitute a unifying element for the department. Also, talks of even broader interest are occasionally presented. The weekly one-hour Monday colloquium lectures are generally evenly split between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University throughout the course of the academic year. Registered students must make a short, 1-paragraph summary of at least 10 colloquium lectures to receive credit.

Grace,Jean A

This one-credit course is a series of once-a-week tutorial sessions designed to help students with their writing at the sentence and paragraph levels. Students work one-on-one with a consultant in the Writing Center, using the papers they produce in their Seminar in Composition as materials for discussion. Much of the work of tutorial sessions is determined by the needs of each student; and consultants report to Seminar in Composition instructors on students' participation in these sessions. Students in Composition Tutorial are graded S/N by their Writing Center consultant on the basis of a final portfolio. Students placed into Composition Tutorial cannot pass Seminar in Composition unless they earn an S grade in Composition Tutorial.

Today a majority of the world’s population lives in cities, and sociologists are increasingly addressing the global policies that shape urban growth and affect the various problems cities face. This course explores some of the leading drivers of global social change, such as the growing importance of information and communications technologies, increased economic integration, global concentration of corporate power, and proliferating social movements. Students will develop projects that explore how these global factors shape different outcomes related to human rights, such as work and labor markets, public health, persistent racial divisions, access to public services, and environmental sustainability. We will also consider the lessons that social movements and sociological research provide about the kinds of changes that can reduce inequality and promote societies where all residents can live dignified lives.

How have we historically thought about ‘nature’ and the ‘environment’, and how has that influenced our perceptions today? Headline-grabbing issues in the media about the science of climate change, and the desecration of natural resources (e.g. Dakota Pipeline; Keep it in the Ground), are premised upon deeply-held assumptions about the relationship between nature and culture, of environment and society. How are recent ideas like the ‘anthropocene’, the politics of risk, and population displacement through resource-based conflict challenging these historical relationships? What social and cultural fault lines are revealed in ‘greenwashing’ by the media and corporate PR, or in the fraught local politics of fracking? By examining a series of environmental issues in depth, including science reporting and the media campaigns of environmental NGOs, we assess the deep influence of certain social and cultural norms in our encounters with the non-human environment. These norms include the aesthetics of landscape, recreational practices in the ‘big outdoors’, but also hybrid natural-cultural practices such as those found in zoos and city parks, botanical gardens, and nature-based theme parks such as SeaWorld or Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

Much of what we know about the social world is based on “folk” experiences and common wisdom. In the social sciences, using the sociological perspective requires the application of rigorous scientific methods to research questions. All methods have the potential to teach us something important, and this course will survey a variety of commonly-used approaches. In this course, students will be introduced to the components of designing and implementing sociological research by understanding: 1) how to ask useful and interesting research questions; 2) the principles of research design; 2) the ethics and politics of different methodological approaches; 3) how to use and compare qualitative and quantitative methods; 4) how to analyze data and draw conclusions; and 5) how to evaluate the research of others. The overall aim of this course is to make students more knowledgeable practitioners and consumers of knowledge.

This course is an examination of a broad  range of social theorists, whose ideas have influenced sociology.  We will read selections of some of the major works of both classical (principally Marx, Weber and Durkheim) and contemporary theorists with the goal of understanding and critically assessing their leading ideas.  Part of this effort will be the task of understanding how the ideas of these thinkers arose in specific social and cultural contexts (i.e., what social problems they thought they were addressing) and in specific intellectual traditions (i.e., what preceding ideas they were borrowing from and bending to their purposes).  The course readings and lecture discussions will also emphasize the continuing relevance of these ideas by examining how they are used (in various modified forms) in some current examples of sociological research.

This course will introduce social problems from a sociological perspective to see how our personal lives are connected with larger social realities. We will look at how major systems of power such as racism, sexism, classism, and heterosexism are interrelated. We will also learn about what constitutes a social problem. Who, for example, defines what a social problem is? Why do some social problems receive so much attention, while others are ignored?  We will explore ways in which social problems are part of the organization of society, and ways we can use our own agency to address them.

This seminar reviews theories used by anthropological archaeologists who deal with prehistoric archaeological records. Behavioral theories from cultural anthropology and other branches of social science are considered with a view to understanding how these theories need to be adjusted for application to ancient times. Dimensions of the archaeological record (form, space, time) are considered in terms of relating unobservable ancient behaviors to the material residues of those behaviors currently observable in the archaeological record.

Only recently, however, have evolutionists begun to focus their explanatory tools on cognition, motivation, emotion, perception, relationships and family. This course will examine the rationale and future of evolutionary approaches to psychological phenomena. Initial lectures on the status of evolutionary theory will prepare students for the discussion and evaluation of evolutionary psychology that will follow.

The Italian physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was the decisive figure in the rise of modern science. First, he ushered in a new era in astronomy when he aimed a 30-powered telescope at the sky in 1610. Second, he revolutionized the concept of science when he argued that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics. Finally, he astounded the theologians, who eventually condemned him to life imprisonment, when he claimed that the scientist's search for the truth cannot be constrained by religious authority. This course will study Galileo in the broader intellectual, social, and religious context of early modern Europe.

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

In this section of Seminar in Composition, we will explore reading and writing by considering the interrelationship of college education and the community life of Pittsburgh. Students in this section will engage in service-learning, pairing meaningful service in the community with the academic work for the course. Throughout the term, the students will provide service with community organizations of their choice; students can expect to devote about 2-3 hours a week, for a total of thirty hours of service over the course of the term. Our discussions will focus on their experiences during this service work as well as their reflections on this experience as guided by a sequence of critical readings and short essay assignments. We will be working every week to read and discuss the essays that the students produce for this course. By considering these subjects in this community context, our goal will be to improve the essay-writing skills students bring to this course by helping them to become more critical readers and writers.

The Art Of The Essay

This semester we will explore what it means to remember the past and to write memory. Our project will be to trouble the idea that writing memory is to record accurately the past, pure and simple. Instead, we will investigate how people choose to represent the past through memorials, histories, monuments, essays, and memoirs and consider how these representations are attempts to compose a particular kind of meaning and message from a particular perspective. Our questions, then, for the semester will be the following: What do memory texts do, not so much for the past, but for the present and future? How do they shape understandings of how things were but also how they should be? We'll answer these questions by both analyzing and composing memory texts.

This course introduces students to the issues associated with the teaching of English language with special attention to instruction at the K-12 level.  Topics include language acquisition and development, standard and non-standard dialects, and issues of composing and analyzing language.  A primary consideration of the course is the way historical and cultural forces influence the teaching of English and shape evaluations of what constitutes "correct" and "literate" uses of language.  The course can be used to fill teacher certification requirements

This course examines the history and conventions of gothic fiction. We will read closely a range of gothic fictions to consider their treatment of such matters as sexuality, nation, race, and class, and to consider how the fantastical rendition of such political and social matters is related to the historical and cultural circumstances in which gothic fictions are written and read.

Public and Professional Writing (PPW) internships offer you a productive, substantive writing experience in which you learn from and contribute to the sponsoring agency, company, or project. You will also learn more about theoretical, social, or historical issues of writing in public and professional environments through your work in one-on-one meetings with administrators from the PPW program. And you'll have the valuable experience of presenting your reflections on your internship in some form to your peers. PPW interns spend at least 50 percent of their on-site time writing. They keep a journal, write about their experience, meet regularly with the associate director or director of the PPW program, and work with a Writing Center consultant on their final presentation. Interns can access a discussion board that allows them to share their reflections on their experiences and prepare for their presentations. Students commit a minimum of 12-15 hours per week to the internships and are expected to perform as reliable and responsible professionals. Students who are employed may petition to create their own internship, provided that it encompasses a new and distinct project and is not a part of a traditional workload.

Film Directors
3 cr.
	
Tu / 01:00 PM-04:50 PM / 0244ACL
Lowenstein,Adam S

1. John Carpenter and David Cronenberg have each carved distinctive reputations for themselves by skillfully manipulating the conventions of a popular generic form: the modern horror film. Carpenter’s Halloween and The Thing, like Cronenberg’s The Fly, Scanners, and Videodrome have shaped fundamentally what cinematic horror means and how it is crafted.  This course juxtaposes their work in order to pose questions concerning the intersection of genre and authorship.  How does each director negotiate the transition from marginalized, independent cinema to more mainstream, studio-supported films?  How does each draw upon and/or challenge an established genre vocabulary?  How might we place Cronenberg's more recent gravitation toward the art film alongside Carpenter’s commitment to revisiting and revising horror and science fiction tropes?  Does Cronenberg's Canadian nationality cast his films in a different light than Carpenter's American work?  Demanding, critically complex readings will open up our discussion of such questions, and students will pose (and answer) questions of their own in essays and journals.  NOTE: The films we will study feature graphic, often very disturbing sex and violence.  This content is crucial to the films and to the course as a whole, so please do not enroll if you do not wish to engage such representations in a serious, critical manner.

This seminar will be an exercise in comparative history--in particular, an examination of the "special relationship" between Britain and the United States. We will look at political, diplomatic and cultural ties between the two nations in the 20' century, ranging from the American "occupation" of Britain during World War Two to the Beatles and the British Invasion of the 1960s to popular and journalistic impressions held of each country in the other. We will read some primary sources, especially newspapers, speeches and memoirs, but mostly will read several of the very good books published on the subject.

This course examines the conditions leading up to the American Revolution, the war years, the framing of the Constitution and establishment of the federal government.  The course will place special emphasis on how the individual colonial political cultures that responded to British imperial policy from 1763-1776 were shaped by the political turmoil in Britain from 1603-1688.  Throughout the course we will trace how American colonists and British policy makers developed differing perceptions of the British Empire and the "rights of freeborn Englishmen" in the empire. The course concludes with an analysis of how the various and contentious groups of newly minted "Americans" worked out the revolutionary settlement in framing and ratification of the United States Constitution.

We will discuss the determinants of Hitler’s rise to power and of German expansionism in the 1930’s. We will examine the military struggle of World War II, but such topics as economic mobilization, propaganda, occupation policies, resistance movements and the Holocaust also receive significant attention. The course concludes with an analysis of war-time diplomacy, the postwar settlement, and the onset of the Cold War.

Religions Of The West
3 cr.
HS COM			
MoWeFr / 11:00 AM-11:50 AM / 00232CL
Shear, Adam

This course is a historical introduction to the religious traditions that developed in ancient Near East and the Mediterranean. Our major emphasis is on the history of the religious traditions that emerged in late antiquity in this area and which continue to be major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Zoroastrianism. We focus on key concepts, historical developments, and contemporary issues. Throughout the course, we also examine interactions among these religious traditions. In the last part of the course we examine the issue of globalization and the spread of these religions around the world as well as the presence of "non-Western" religion in the "West." The course also serves as an introduction to the academic study of religion and provides a foundation for further coursework in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. No prior knowledge of any of the religions studied is expected or assumed.

Batista,Kenneth

Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

Ruth,Christopher T

Does music have the ability to narrate? How do musical narratives work? Can methodologies from related disciplines be applied to the analysis of musical narrative structures? This seminar is designed to address these issues, among others, and provide for the student familiarity with narrative theory as it applies to musical works, both with text and without text. The first half of the class will—for the most part—be devoted to a critical assessment of several classic writings of narrative theory, these in tandem with various essays on the possible application of this theory to instrumental music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and to the general business of writing about music. The only music considered in detail will be that brought up in the various essays; our basic concerns will be theoretical and meta-theoretical.

This course will examine the scope of cyber-crime and its impact on today’s system of criminal justice. Similarly, the vulnerabilities to cyber-assault will be examined. Topics include the use of computer technology to commit crimes such as “hacking” and other computer based criminology, as well as means of committing more traditional violations of law. Also included will be an analysis of the legal considerations facing law enforcement and other cyber-security professionals who are tasked with meeting the challenges of discovering, investigating and prosecuting cyber-crimes. Since our economy and security enterprises are so dependent on the electronic dissemination of information, effective measures to secure this vital resource will be explored. Given the fact that funds are transferred electronically, the electronic transmission of finances will be examined as well as the more basic methods of raising funds and laundering same to advance terrorist activities throughout the world.

In 1866, in an apartment building in St. Petersburg, Russia, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov decides to “rid the world of evil” by murdering an old pawnbroker with an axe. The complex actions of this young student—the protagonist of Dostoevskii’s novel Crime and Punishment (1866)—have since inspired a number of texts that address, develop, and re-cast the questions that Dostoevsky raises. Taking Crime and Punishment as a starting point, this course will trace representations of the superior individual in monumental European texts (literature, film, drama, and music) from the nineteenth century, with works like Tolstoi’s “The Kreutzer Sonata” (1889), through the twentieth century, with texts such as Hesse’s (1917), Camus’s The Stranger (1942), and Hitchcock’s Rope (1948), and ending with contemporary works such as Kalin’s film Swoon (1992) and Logan’s play Never the Sinner (1999). As a supplement we will read philosophical and theoretical works by Berdiaev, Schopenhauer, Solov'ev, Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, which specifically address the theme of the literary Superman. We will also examine questions of adaptation as the Superman is transformed through literature, film, philosophy, drama, and music.

This research skills seminar immerses students in the research process, with particular emphasis placed on analyzing the urban environment.  Active participation will give students exposure to many important research techniques, and will provide experience in conducting practical fieldwork. This semester’s focus is on the gentrification frontier in the City of Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood.  Students will learn research and communication skills, will locate, gather and analyze relevant data, and will use research methods to address practical urban problems.  In-class discussions will critically examine examples of published urban research and different data presentation methods. Note that this course meets once per week—seminar sessions and independent data collection will occur in the research neighborhood: travel to and from the study site will be required.

We live so much of our lives in our heads and on our phones, remembering the past and dreaming of the future. It’s a virtual life, a life lived in the ether. Yet our experiences are shaped by the bodies we inhabit: a body that is seen, defined, and received by others. In this course, students will explore—through writing that is critical and creative—what it means to move through the world embodied. How does living in a female, male, black, trans, young, or differently-abled body shape our perspective? How are science and technology (chimeras, AI) challenging the way we think about our bodies? We’ll take in art at the Carnegie Museum and at the Warhol, as well as attend a performance downtown—all material for writing.

Because the focus is on task-centered communication, the class is conducted entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for Elementary French 1 are:  a) to speak French well enough to describe, narrate and ask questions in the present about a variety of everyday topics such as family, work, eating and traveling; b) to make short statements and answer simple questions about the past; c) to understand French well enough to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations about everyday topics; d) to understand simple written French well enough to grasp main ideas and some supporting details; e) to write sentences and short paragraphs on everyday topics; f) to develop an awareness of French-speaking cultures; f) to understand, at a basic level, how French functions as a language.  This course is for students with little or no previous exposure to the language and its cultures.

This course is for students who have successfully completed German 0002 or who have placed into the course on the basis of the department placement test. German 0003 will provide students with opportunities to strengthen their listening and speaking abilities and mastery of German grammar, to read a variety of short authentic texts as well as a longer adapted book, and to write longer and more complex compositions than those assigned in Elementary German courses. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. They will also work with web materials, complete a variety of assignments online, and work on a project. Together with GER 0004, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

This course is designed to help students with weak mathematical backgrounds review algebra. For faster paced or more advanced courses, students who know algebra should consider either Math 0032, 0100, or 0200, which can be used to satisfy the algebra requirement and/or prepare students for calculus. In this course emphasis will be placed on the visualization of algebra concepts with a graphing calculator . Topics include: linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential and logarithmic functions. The instructor lectures three time each week and undergraduate teaching assistants lead problem solving recitation sessions once each week. This course serves as a prerequisite for Math 0120 and, together with 0032, as a prerequisite for Math 0220. A graphing calculator, TI-83 or equivalent, is required. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

This seminar explores scientific models of knowledge and humanistic models of knowledge in Plotinus and the intellectual movement known as Neoplatonism. We will study Plotinus’s Enneads and other sources by focusing on a variety of philosophical, cultural, and historical aspects, such as methods of inquiry, patterns of antagonism with Christianity, the definition of disciplinary boundaries, the notion of the self, the production and transmission of texts in the school, first principles, the conception of matter, nature, soul, and the categories of being that Western science appropriated from this enormously influential cultural tradition.

This course is a study of the history of French colonization of the “New World” of the Americas from the sixteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, just after the second World War. By adopting an “Atlantic” approach, we will examine Europe, Africa and the Americas as interconnected regions. The course explores several themes: Voyages et Rencontres; les Français en Amérique du Nord; la Traite des Noirs; les Lumières et le Nouveau Monde; et Révolution à Saint-Domingue. Although each theme treats a different region and highlights a different time period, our approach will allow us to follow the writings of explorers, philosophers, administrators, generals, merchants, and former slaves around the Atlantic, from the coasts of France and West Africa, to the eastern United States, and south to the Caribbean and South American mainland.

Sculpture Studio 1 is a broadly-based course that introduces students to the expressive potential of modeled and constructed form. Throughout the course, students explore a variety of sculpture techniques and materials in projects that study characteristics of natural and abstract form. The principle goals of the course are to develop skills and to provide a basis for individual creative development. Students will gain sensitivity in the observation of form, develop analytic and compositional skills, and formulate ideas through practical experience. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting. Students must purchase basic sculpture tools and materials. In addition, there is a $30.00 lab fee.

Huffman, David

Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them; and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

This course examines artistic works produced in prison and artistic works about prison, addressing both the allure of the criminal world as a form of entertainment and the function of art within prison as escapism and survival technique. In structure the course is broken into three parts: the first part concentrates on prison writings and criminal culture in America; the second part focuses on the forced-labor camp system known as the Gulag in the Soviet Union; and the third part examines Europe (Germany and Eastern Europe) during the Holocaust.

 “Medieval” is often used as a byword for brutality and backwardness; in fiction and film, the European Middle Ages are frequently a locus of chivalry, sorcery, and grime. This course will interrogate the reputation of the Middle Ages in modern culture by examining a variety of primary sources from medieval western Europe as well as scholarly literature on several historiographical problems of the Middle Ages, including Crusade ideology; chivalry and gender roles; and race, ethnicity, and toleration. We will also consider these issues as portrayed in modern fiction, film, and television, and students will contribute to the debate about medievalism and the uses of the Middle Ages through several short papers.

Bannon,Michael John

The course on rhetorical criticism focuses on the history, methods, and practice of modern rhetorical criticism. At its most fundamental level, rhetorical criticism message analysis of rhetorical artifacts. A rhetorical artifact is the tangible, retrievable trace or recording of an original interaction in which symbols are used to communicate a message. We apply the methods of rhetorical criticism to rhetorical artifacts in order to analyze and interpret the meaning of symbolic messages. The course has been designed to help you become acquainted with contemporary methods of rhetorical criticism through a combination of lectures, discussions, papers, and practical applications. Course objectives include recognizing the vital importance of accurate message analysis in comprehending the modern world; developing a daily critical perspective to guide informed judgments; studying and understanding rhetorical criticism as practiced in the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries; demonstrating the ability to perform rhetorical criticism by using conventional research methods to conduct analyses of significant rhetorical artifacts; developing and sharpening discussion, research and critical analysis skills, and writing proficiency. As a designated Writing Proficiency (W) course, it is structured to help you improve your writing abilities. This section is highly interactive and will be graded on the basis of participation, short papers illustrating the student’s ability to apply the following rhetorical criticism methods to an artifact: close textual analysis, pentadic analysis, ideological criticism, narrative criticism, and genre criticism, and one longer paper using a method or combination of methods of the student’s choice, and including a brief presentation of findings. It is an upper level, methods course designed for junior and senior Communication majors.

Forty years ago, most economists could get by with just a rudimentary knowledge of calculus and linear algebra. Today, economic theorists have to be well versed in many fields of advanced mathematics. Although we will make a brief review of topics in optimization and matrix theory, this course is primarily an introduction to real analysis, the mathematical environment that provides the foundation for modern economics. The emphasis will be on learning how to understand and write proofs, which is essential for reading and writing papers in modern journals.

Focusing on a variety of musical traditions throughout the world, this course addresses factors that have influenced historical and contemporary musical performance practices. Special attention is placed on how political, economic, social, and religious factors influence musical aesthetics and notions of identity among performers and audiences. Positioning music within a broader context of postcolonial, technological, and transnational development, this course analyzes the ever-changing relationship between traditional and modern socio-musical approaches toward performance techniques, musical transmission, and intercultural exchange.

Cacalano,Gia Therese

Pilates fusion is based on the Pilates system, but is more movement centered, as we transition from one form to the next through movement stretches taken from release methods.  These release methods are designed to lengthen and to soften the muscles.  The movements are constant, so there is flow and connection rather than a static approach.  There is a focus on proper form, finding center through the pelvis, core strengthening and its relation to the back.  Techniques from Yoga practice are also incorporated into this class.

In this course we will examine the functioning of neurons and synapses, the basic units responsible for fast communication within the nervous system. The course will focus on the elegant use of electrical mechanisms by the nervous system, and on the powerful quantitative approach to scientific investigation that is fundamental to neurophysiology. Topics that will be addressed include: principles of electric current flow exploited by the nervous system; the basis of the resting potential of neurons; the structure and function of voltage-gated and neurotransmitter-gated ion channels; generation and propagation of action potentials; the physiology of fast synaptic communication.

The course carries three credits and satisfies the Arts & Sciences skills requirement for Quantitative and Formal Reasoning. It is one of the very few courses offered at the University of Pittsburgh that are designed specifically to address the knowledge and skills involved in quantitative and formal reasoning within the context of the interests and needs of students in the humanities. The course meets three days a week for fifty minutes and involves a combination of lecture, discussion, and practical programming exercises. There are no prerequisites; in particular, students are not expected to have any prior computer programming experience and they are not required to know any foreign languages. On the other hand, as is the norm for courses with 1000-level numbers, students should have some experience with college-level study, especially in the humanities; this will assist them in identifying interesting humanities research questions, which they will then explore with the computational skills they will acquire in the course. Students may enroll under any of the cross-listed rubrics and both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. Whether the course satisfies requirements for a departmental major is up to the individual departments, and interested students should inquire about this with their major advisors. For undergraduate students, the course carries a University Honors College (UHC) designation. For more information about UHC courses, see http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/courses. For information about enrolling in UHC courses, see http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/course-eligibility. In addition to CourseWeb (Blackboard), this course has its own web site, which is located at http://dh.obdurodon.org.

Bondar, Greg

The course carries three credits and satisfies the Arts & Sciences skills requirement for Quantitative and Formal Reasoning. It is one of the very few courses offered at the University of Pittsburgh that are designed specifically to address the knowledge and skills involved in quantitative and formal reasoning within the context of the interests and needs of students in the humanities. The course meets three days a week for fifty minutes and involves a combination of lecture, discussion, and practical programming exercises. There are no prerequisites; in particular, students are not expected to have any prior computer programming experience and they are not required to know any foreign languages. On the other hand, as is the norm for courses with 1000-level numbers, students should have some experience with college-level study, especially in the humanities; this will assist them in identifying interesting humanities research questions, which they will then explore with the computational skills they will acquire in the course. Students may enroll under any of the cross-listed rubrics and both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. Whether the course satisfies requirements for a departmental major is up to the individual departments, and interested students should inquire about this with their major advisors. For undergraduate students, the course carries a University Honors College (UHC) designation. For more information about UHC courses, see http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/courses. For information about enrolling in UHC courses, see http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/course-eligibility. In addition to CourseWeb (Blackboard), this course has its own web site, which is located at http://dh.obdurodon.org.

This course is a partial survey of some important strands in the Western intellectual history. We will start with ancient Greek speculations in cosmology, philosophy, and medicine. Then we will look at some important subsequent developments in these areas and how they were influenced by the Greek tradition. These include, among other topics, the magical tradition that flourished during the Renaissance period. The latter half of the course will focus on the profound intellectual transformations in the 17th century which constitute what we often call The Scientific Revolution. The great scientific achievements of figures such as Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton will be discussed in detail. Overall, this course is meant to provide a broad picture of some of the most important elements in the Western intellectual tradition and their interactions in history.

This course combines elements of mass and energy balances, thermodynamics, separations, and product design in order to set the foundation for the remainder of the chemical engineering curriculum.  This course introduces chemical engineering problem solving techniques from both a (traditional) process-centric viewpoint as well as a product centric viewpoint.  The course will span from theoretical (basic thermodynamics) to applied (separations) allowing a simple route to problem-based learning of difficult theoretical concepts.

This "W" course is an introduction to the theoretical treatment of the real numbers, sets, functions, sequences, and limits. Classwork and homework will concentrate on the writing and understanding of proofs of theorems centered on these topics. For most students, the techniques of reading and doing proofs will be new. Two recitations per week, therefore, are required to practice this skill as well as to rehearse the many definitions of mathematical concepts in the course. It is required for all Mathematics and Statistics majors except for Departmental Honors majors who may wish to accelerate by substituting Mathematics 0450 for 0413 and 0420, and then taking Advanced Calculus. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

Writing For The Public
3 cr.
W	
We / 06:00 PM-08:30 PM / 00216CL


This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals; press kits; editorials; informational Web sites; articles; and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

Complex engineered materials are a new class of systems comprising a variety of inorganic materials. This course is designed to introduce the principles and various functional properties exhibited by inorganic materials at the Nano, Micro and Meso scales. Since inorganic materials comprising metallic and non-metallic systems are a very complicated class of materials that display myriad properties, this course is outlined to discuss the most important properties. Thus, the course will mainly cover optical, electrical, thermal and electrochemical properties of both crystalline and amorphous inorganic complex engineered materials. In each category, the principles underlining each property will be discussed followed by the material class, behavior and applications. The effect of microstructure on each of the properties will also be discussed. The course objective is to introduce the student to these complex engineered materials family and their properties. In doing so, the student should be able to identify a material for a particular application.

Intended for persons who are currently teaching German, intend to do so in the near future, or those who have been in the classroom and would like to update their knowledge of recent pedagogical developments. This seminar will concern itself with both the theoretical and the practical issues of foreign language instruction. The theoretical section will be devoted to the reading and discussion of current literature on subjects including: students' learning styles and strategies, the teaching of the four basic language skills, lesson planning, use of instructional techniques and strategies, teaching vocabulary, effectiveness of pattern drills, use of games in the classroom, use of authentic texts, student-teacher interaction, testing, grading, use of technology, and teaching culture. These discussions will be augmented by practical sessions devoted to material development and micro teaching demonstrations. It is the goal of micro teaching to provide each course participant with the opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge that he/she has acquired, as well as to profit from peer evaluation. Requirements for the course will include: writing a publishable textbook review, visiting language classes, presenting micro lessons, and designing an instructional project on a pedagogical topic.

The literature, art, and culture of medieval and Renaissance Italy has had a profound impact on Western culture that continues in the present day. This course explores Italian culture during this pivotal period, introducing students to Dante's Inferno and its astonishing account of the author's journey through Hell, as well as works by Petrarch, Boccaccio, and other major Italian authors. The class will investigate connections between Italian literature in this period and developments in painting, sculpture, music, and other art forms. We will reflect critically on the appropriateness of the positive value judgments conventionally linked with the use of the term "Renaissance," with particular attention to the difficulties faced by women and minority groups during this period. No prerequisites. No knowledge of Italian is required. The course satisfies the the School of Arts & Sciences Foreign Culture Requirement.

Painting Studio 1 is an introduction to techniques of oil painting and diverse subject matter for compositional development and creative expression. Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting Studio 1. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit. Painting Studio 1 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

The objective of this course is to present a detailed analysis of our understanding of the functional organization of the human brain. This is accomplished by discussing disturbances of function, which are found in neurological diseases. The disturbed function is then analyzed in the context of our understanding of the normal function of the brain as this is derived from study of the intact human brain and animal experimentation. The course progresses from simple problems of motor and sensory processing to complex functions such as memory, language and cognition. Students who do not meet the prerequisites and wish to enroll must obtain consent of the instructor.

How did the inhabitants of hundreds of small and quarrelsome cities in a poor, Mediterranean peninsula collaborate to produce one of human history’s most innovative and influential civilizations? To answer that, we will survey the history of ancient Greece from the Minoan civilization in the second millennium BC to the end of the Classical Period in the 4th century BC. We will investigate the major political, intellectual, economic, and social factors that contributed to the nature and development of Greek history, and consider the many political and cultural institutions that made this age unique. We will focus particularly on the growth and intertwined histories of the Greek city-states (especially Athens and Sparta), their encounters with the Persian Empire, their conflicts with each other, and their efforts to cope with the rising power of Macedon. All readings will be in English

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

This course will deal with word structure and morphological processes in natural language (inflection, agreement, derivation, compounding, incorporation, cliticization, reduplication). The data to be analyzed will be drawn from a wide range of the world's languages. The relationship between morphology and other components of the grammar (syntax, phonology, the lexicon, pragmatics) will occupy a central place in the syllabus. Finally, considerations of typology, change, processing, and acquisition will be addressed. By and large, the approaches followed will be those of generative linguistics (Lexical Morphology, Prosodic Morphology, Distributed Morphology, etc.). The course presupposes a general linguistics course.

This course will examine the intersections between literature and the environment by considering the textual representations of weather and climate.  We will read drama, poetry, fiction, and nonfiction works from the Renaissance to the present, with a focus on literature from the romantics to the twentieth century; readings will include a Shakespeare play, lyric poetry, canonical short fictions, and speculative fiction.  We will examine these texts in conjunction with works of literary criticism as well as works in the meteorological humanities, which brings together such disciplines as art history, environmental studies, geology, history, and philosophy.  Throughout, we will be attentive both to the literary qualities of writings about weather and climate and to the historical and political contexts of those writings.

Enthusiasm goes a long way in the nonprofit environmental world, but volunteers and professionals alike increasingly need more and more skills in order to make a lasting impact. It can be overwhelming even to those who already know what to expect. This course covers the "inner workings" of environmental organizations. We'll go beyond the slogans, junk mail, and big events to study what's behind the nonprofit world, what it takes to succeed, and why advocacy is so important... and so difficult! Speakers from the environmental community will share their experiences and perspectives each week, and a wide range of readings and assignments are designed to have students take a deep look and to experience some of this world, too.

Hazwoper (hazardous waste operations and emergency response) is a 40-hour course that promotes awareness of safety and response plans for those who may work with chemical and other hazards in the work-site. Students will learn how hazardous materials are handled and identified; human responses to exposure; learn what to do in case of site emergencies; use appropriate safety methods and work practice controls; and understand labels that are used to alert personnel of danger involving hazardous material.  (Many employers in environmental consulting firms and other industries require 40-hour osha training.) The course will count as an elective in the environmental studies major.

This course is an elective in the journalism sequence whose target audience is Pitt News staffers. However, non-staffers who wish to join the Pitt News are welcome to enroll with the understanding that there is no guarantee they will become staffers, which is the sole prerogative of the Pitt News, not the instructor. The class will be a vehicle for an ongoing critique of the Pitt News with special emphasis on the published work of class members. Discussion will focus on the writing and reporting process ' practicing the skills needed to generate story ideas, develop sources, cover beats, craft stories and build strong relationships between student editor and reporter. At least six stories must be published according to predetermined deadlines and assignments. Non-staffers who are not hired by the Pitt News must make every effort to get six features published in the Pitt News or work out six assignments with the instructor's approval. Readings will include stories in the Post-Gazette and a national newspaper of the instructor's choice.

This course is designed to introduce students to the idea of normative political theory and to important authors and concepts in the western political theory tradition.  Students will learn to understand both historical and contemporary debates surrounding important political concepts such as authority, justice, liberty, and democracy, and to appreciate the differences among normative, empirical, logical, and faith-based political claims.  Students will learn to read critically and analytically, to make simple normative arguments, and to explain the specific role of normative arguments in political science and political life.  Depending on the interests, area of expertise, and inclinations of the particular instructor, some of these may be emphasized more heavily than others.

Chilson,Clark Van Doren

This class serves as an introduction to the major religious traditions of China and Japan (and sometimes India). During the course of the semester, we encounter the native Confucian, Daoist (Taoist), and popular traditions of China, and the Shintō, folk and new religions of Japan. Buddhism, which originated in India but later spread to East Asia, is examined in its relation to the history of both Chinese and Japanese religions. We approach these traditions through lectures and discussion based on Chinese classical and popular literature, secondary scholarship, and films, which inform us about cultural and historical context, beliefs, practices, and personal experience. In the process we expect to learn something about the ways in which non-Western religious traditions see themselves and their world on their own terms, and to see how/if they can complement our own worldviews.

As East Asia becomes more and more central to the world's modern commodity culture, some have predicted a decline in traditional religious values and practices. In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China to Korea and Japan, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased "investment" in religion. This course presents a thematic survey of popular religion in contemporary East Asia, informed by religious, cultural, and political history, and takes a look at how religion participates in shaping the respective worldviews, behaviors, and practices of modern East Asian societies. It further reviews the various responses to the dilemma of self-identity and self-representation suggested by the changing role religion sees for itself in contemporary East Asia and explores the relationship between religion and politics, class, and gender. The course treats the changes we see within East Asian cultures not so much as breaks with tradition but as responses to older themes and behaviors that have been reinterpreted to make themselves relevant to the needs of modern society. We approach this course through lectures, discussions, readings, and films.

Major assignments include a set of career materials (resume, cover letter, career report); a correspondence packet that addresses a conflict; a proposal; and a longer report based on research and analysis. As we engage in this work we will explore the nature of professionalism, common features and efforts (enabling and disabling) of professional discourse, and strategies for negotiating the "borders" of specialized and non-specialized discourse.

In today's marketplace, proposals produce billions of dollars to help solve problems and support causes that people care about. Grant proposals make possible important research in the natural, behavioral, and social sciences; they enable many to benefit from civic and educational projects; and they benefit community development and fund artistic achievement. Other types of proposals allow people to start businesses, create change on the job, and define projects that meet the needs of particular audiences. This course will allow students to understand the functions and conventions of proposals, the types of research that they require, and the processes that generate them and lead to approval. Students will focus on two main issues: developing a proposal (which includes activities such as defining needs, reviewing existing projects and literature, and, if seeking a grant, researching sources of funds) and writing a proposal with a specific audience in mind. Coursework will help students develop an understanding of proposal writing from an initial idea through final submission. Students will complete a variety of written pieces leading up to the final proposal, which may be valuable in their employment portfolios. Upon completion of this course, students will have acquired the research and writing skills necessary to write successful proposals.

Wilson,Alistair J

This course introduces basic tools in applied econometrics that are commonly employed in government, business, and academic research.  It should be useful for those intending to become quantitative business and economic analysts, as well as those interested in knowing how economics is applied to real-world problems: particularly useful for those interested in pursuing graduate work in economics, business and law. Students are expected to become familiar with Stata, a computer program that is often used in quantitative economic research. Topics covered are: a review of basic statistical inference theory, correlation analysis, classical linear regression models (simple and multiple), and associated inferential problems, and generalized linear regression models and associated inferential problems.

British Film
3 cr.

Whitehead,Jeffrey Robert

This course will focus on post World War Two transformations in British culture, society, and British cinema history.  The Ealing films of the late 1940s (e.g. Passport to Pimlico (1949) and Whisky Galore [1949]) dramatize some of these transformations.  Further challenges to traditional and mythic conceptions of Britishness are evident in popular genres (e.g. the Carry On series and the Hammer horror films) and through the counter-culture of the "Swinging Sixties" identified with cinema, its stars, music, fashion, and their ties to European cinematic culture.  With the triumph of the "Iron Lady "(Margaret Thatcher) in the 1970s to1990s, British cinema had its own "New Wave" in the modernist and experimental work of such filmmakers as Derek Jarman, Peter Greenaway, Stephen Frears, and Ken Loach.  This same period also boasteda wave of "heritage" films identified with Merchant Ivory (e.g. Howard's End, 1992) and Goldcrest Films (Chariots of Fire, 1981 and Hope and Glory, 1987) that were popular and profitable.  More recently the transnational films of Neal Jordan (e. g. The Butcher Boy[1997]and Breakfast on Pluto[2005]) are examples of innovative directions in Irish-British cinema.  The course will also include instances of experimental cinema on television (Channel Four) as well as popular British sitcoms.

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

TuTh / 09:30 AM-10:45 AM / 00221CL


This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

 This course emphasizes the mathematics and problem-solving skills necessary to be an intelligent user of a variety of computational tools for engineering analysis.  The first portion of the course focuses on linear algebra within the context of engineering problems.  Concepts of numerical linear algebra are then introduced, followed by a brief introduction to additional discrete analysis tools such as numerical approximation and signal processing.  Lastly, through the introduction of cad software and an individual term project, students are taught how to independently gain familiarity and confidence with engineering software.

MoWe / 10:00 AM-10:50 AM / 00G24CL


In this course we will examine a handful of classic works tackling the central questions of philosophy.  In particular, we will be concerned with the questions: is there any certain method for acquiring knowledge, or are all of our beliefs just guesses?  Is there such a thing as objective knowledge?  Are there facts about who is right and who is wrong in moral disputes – or just differences of opinion?  We will examine a handful of the most influential works ever written about these questions.  This course aims both to familiarize students with philosophical disputes and to develop skills for recognizing, understanding, and evaluating arguments in some difficult texts.

This course addresses two of the great revolutions in science of the twentieth century; relativity and quantum mechanics. These revolutions were indispensable in reaching an understanding of physical phenomena at the atomic and subatomic scales. The twentieth century also involved major advances in understanding and analyzing a raft of phenomena in macroscopic systems; this course will contain a segment on thermal and statistical physics, essential for appreciating the complexities of macroscopic matter.

This course introduces students to major developments and figures in German cultural history from the Medieval Period to the Enlightenment. The course utilizes a variety of media (written texts as well as audio-visual materials) and genres (prose, poetry, drama) in order to analyze how the past informs the present. Topics of discussion include: the individual's place in society; the role of women and the notion of love in courtly literature (Minnelyrik, Höfisches Epos); Martin Luther and the Reformation; the 30 Years War and the Peace of Westphalia as the beginning of a new world order; the radical change of European worldview by the Enlightenment; and more recent reception and interpretation of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Enlightenment periods. This course is conducted entirely in German, and gives students ample opportunity to practice all four language skills (speaking, reading, writing, and listening). All assignments are to be completed in German.

The Family and the State in German Culture.  As a senior capstone seminar this course encourages students to develop their own interests in German culture, language, and history through an intense research seminar. The guiding topic is the relationship between the family and the state as represented in German culture from the Enlightenment to the present. Why do specific configurations of familial relations appear at certain times, how are these challenged and reconfigured, and how do these reflect forces and tendencies that transcend the intimate and familial spheres? Students will study the relationship of the family to the state both in theory (Aristotle, Hegel, Riehl, Engels, and contemporary feminist and queer theorists) and in texts and films from the 18th to the 21st centuries including authors such as Lessing, Kleist, Droste-Hülshoff, Hauptmann, Schnitzler, Brecht, and Wolf.  Students will set their own research emphasis in their capstone project (the topic must be chosen early in the term) and will analyze one cultural object in detail while relating it to at least one perspective on the family or state within a larger historical context.  They will present their project publicly during the Spring semester.

Denova,Rebecca I

This course will introduce students to ancient Egyptian religious thought and practice with its massive temples, multitude of gods and goddesses and fascinating funeral rites. We will explore the mythic cycle of Creation and Osirian cycle of betrayal, revenge, death and rebirth, as well as the place of myriad local and minor deities within Egyptian mythology. We will also consider the dynamics of the "monotheistic" revolution of Akhenaton. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Egypt, students will encounter the interaction of sacred and secular, and the relationship between state cults and private worship by nobles and commoners alike. A special feature of the course includes sessions at the Egyptian Exhibit of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and designing public educational materials that will help illuminate this ancient culture.

People have used stone to accomplish many different things for a very long time. Today, archaeologists study prehistoric patterns of stone tool production and use to track, understand, and evaluate the evolution of human behavior, cognition, and social organization around the world. This class will explore theoretical and methodological approaches to the analysis of stone artifacts, including chipped, ground, and polished tools as well as the by-products of their manufacture, for the purpose of revealing human behavior from the Lower Paleolithic to the recent era. Topics will include debates over tool form and function, questions about human mobility and trade, recent advances in the scientific approach to materials identification, the history of creative experimental replication, ideas about the nature of innovation and social learning, and a foundation in both lithic raw materials (obsidian, flint, slate, etc.) and stone tool typology (arrow heads, hand axes, metates, etc.). Two primary objectives will cross-cut all of our explorations: 1) understanding how to read behavior from patterns in archaeological data, and 2) gathering insight on the nature of technological evolution across different time scales.

This course aims to introduce students to twentieth century Japanese history, contemporary culture and social institutions. It will give students a range of different exposures-using scholarly books, essays, fiction and film-to look at various conditions and aspects of Japanese culture and everyday life: imperialism, World War II, high economic growth, middle class society, gender relations, education, youth crime, and mass culture. The special focus of this class (which we will spend two weeks on) is Japanese mass culture that is increasingly being exported around the world. We will consider the postwar history of Japanese mass culture and the conditions of and reasons for its growing popularity abroad. We will examine what audiences are most receptive to it, which genres translate better than others, and what changes are made in the process of translation.

This course examines Slavic and anglophone science fiction comparatively. It assesses how a given culture's dominant values are articulated in a popular genre that enjoys different status in the East (i.e., Eastern Europe) and the West (i.e., England and America). Those values emerge in works that imaginatively posit "fantastic" situations rooted in biological, spatial, and temporal explorations beyond those currently verified by science. On the basis of films (e.g., "The Terminator", "The Fly"), film clips, TV shows, novels (e.g., "Solaris", "The Futurological Congress"), novellas, and stories, we shall discuss such topics as progress, utopia, human perfectibility, the limits of science, and the nature of knowledge.

What is art?  This introductory course, designed for students with no previous background in art or art history, is intended to probe this question – and challenge traditional assumptions -- while providing students with the skills to interpret works of art and architecture from a diversity of world cultures.  The course is designed to demonstrate some of the basic tools of analysis with which to approach works of art as material and aesthetic objects while also examining them as productions that negotiate with historical and cultural contexts.  The course also thinks pointedly about cultural difference and the ways in which art has been employed to define communities as radically particular while also answering basic human needs that connect people living in different times and places.

We often think of science, art, and writing as separate disciplines, but what happens when we approach writing about science artfully? Through a series of reading and writing assignments, accompanied by field studies, creative workshops, and film screenings, students will explore culture and their own positions in the world, using science, nature, and technology as lenses to examine their observations and experiences, and as subjects for critical inquiry. Questions we will explore in this course include: What do our ways of interacting with science and nature reveal about our senses of self and about culture? How do our own interests and involvements in science reflect and shape our perception of and understanding of the world around us? How are our assumptions and values revealed through our writing about science and nature? How does writing about science—in the news, creative nonfiction pieces, and digital modes—shape our ideas? As writers, how can we use science and nature figuratively to reach fuller understandings of our ideas? Disclaimer: This is neither a technical writing course nor a science course! Our primary tasks will be to investigate intelligent, creative ways of writing and to use writing to engage in critical inquiry. We’ll surround and infuse these tasks with our multilayered explorations of science and nature. This course is appropriate for students of all majors, not just the sciences.

The presence of women in the history of Italian culture will be examined in the contexts of fiction and non-fiction short narrative, poetry, theater, opera and film. The readings have been selected so has to present the students with a variety of concrete examples of written literary Italian. Such readings, in combination with the viewing of one film and the attendance of one live opera performance (Puccini’s Tosca in the Pittsburgh Opera production scheduled for October), will offer the opportunity for discussion of many different issues related to the central theme. In addition to regular assignments, aimed at reviewing some of the most difficult points of Italian grammar and syntax, students will be asked to complete a series of short 1-2 page papers, mostly critical responses to assigned material, but also detailed summaries or descriptions, and brief creative-writing projects. This course is conducted entirely in Italian, serves as the Italian major mandatory writing practicum and satisfies the School of Arts & Sciences “W” requirement. Prerequisite: Italian 0004 with B- or better.

This course begins with an exploration of indigenous mythologies and religions of the pre-Columbian Americas, as well as traditions from West Africa that have been adapted to cultures in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the U.S. South. After familiarizing ourselves with some of these traditions, we will read works from contemporary Latin American, U.S., and Canadian literature that prove how practices and beliefs lived on through colonization and slavery. We will read and learn about alternative medicines, religious adaptations, approaches to life and death, and other knowledges absent from mainstream education. The theme of this semester’s class is “the curse,” and we will read novels, short stories, poetry, and films that center around conjure, hechizo, gopher, and other forms of curses that appear in the work of authors such as Toni Morrison, Junot Diaz, Isabel Allende, Cristina Garcia, William Faulkner, and Laura Esquivel.

Medieval Government & Society
3 cr.

Greenberg,Janelle

In this class we study the origins of constitutionalism in the Western world, in particular, due process, limited government, the rule of law, representative institutions, and individual rights. As unlikely as it sounds, we will find these origins, along with the basic tenets of the modern democratic polity, in the decidedly undemocratic Middle Ages. Our story begins with the emergence of the three bodies of law upon which the Western legal tradition was built, namely, Roman law, canon law, and English common law. The narrative includes forays into cultural history, for example, the emergence of universities where Roman law and canon law were taught and studied; political history, such as the emergence of the medieval “state,” the quarrels between popes and kings and kings and their nobility; and finally intellectual history, in particular, the political and legal ideas that constitute “the mental furniture of the mind,” those notions of justice, law, and reason that were axiomatic and against which sovereigns and subjects were measured. Readings will include excerpts from law codes, the writings of theorists such as Thomas Aquinas, and works such as Magna Carta. Our work will go forward on the basis of discussions and lectures. Much class time will be spent in small groups, where students are divided up and assigned a particular primary source to dissect and present to the class. In this way we will constitute a community of scholars who work together in a common intellectual endeavor, one that introduces us to some of the most significant texts in the history of Western constitutionalism. There are no course requirements for Medieval Law and Government.

Greenberg,Janelle

This course examines the origins and development of English law and legal institutions from c. 1000 to c. 1700, with a view toward understanding the foundations of the American legal system. Keeping in mind that law is shaped by social, economic, religious and political considerations, we attempt to answer the vital question, "How, and by what processes, did English society solve certain problems with which all societies must eventually cope?" In answering this question we will be concerned with the various mechanisms for resolving legal disputes (e.g., trial by jury, the common law writ system, proof and evidence); rights in land and personal property; and legal relationships between people (e.g., contract, marriage). In addition, we will deal with certain issues in English constitutional law (e.g., the rule of law, ideas of legal sovereignty).

Mind and Medicine deals with problems and questions that arise in considering how the mind plays certain roles in medical theory and practice.  Of course, this means we must think about what the mind is. We will begin this course by looking at nature of emotions (particularly pleasure, fear, and empathy), how they might be explained, and see what role emotions play in judgments.  Then we shall move on to examine briefly the placebo effect, what it is, and how it might function.  From there we shall examine a case of a common mental illness, depression, and use it to examine the nature of explanation in medicine generally. We shall contrast such explanations with those given in evolutionary psychology. Finally, we will examine the some of the interrelations among certain aspects of mind, brain, and body.

This course is a partial survey of some important strands in the Western intellectual history. We will start with ancient Greek speculations in cosmology, philosophy, and medicine. Then we will look at some important subsequent developments in these areas and how they were influenced by the Greek tradition. These include, among other topics, the magical tradition that flourished during the Renaissance period. The latter half of the course will focus on the profound intellectual transformations in the 17th century which constitute what we often call The Scientific Revolution. The great scientific achievements of figures such as Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton will be discussed in detail. Overall, this course is meant to provide a broad picture of some of the most important elements in the Western intellectual tradition and their interactions in history.

This course is intended to expose students to issues regarding the social and ethical implications of technology. In recent years, many computer professionals have become increasingly aware of the societal impacts of the increased use of computer technology in everyday life. While technology promises many benefits to our society and economy, there are also well founded concerns that serious problems may arise. This course is intended to introduce students to the main issues surrounding the computerization of society, and to help students understand the development, application, and consequences of information technology as social as well as technical processes. Topics include computerization and the quality of work life, unemployment, personal privacy and freedom of information, ownership and rights to software, and the manageability, risks and accountability of complex systems. The course seeks to foster in students a critical approach to the understanding of the impact of technology in society via the academic skills of reading, writing and argumentation. The course is designed to meet the program WRIT requirement for CS majors.

This course examines the history of nationalism, ethnicity, and the nation-state. The course provides an overview of nationalism theories, the history of nationalism, and current nationalist challenges in Europe. Particular emphasis is placed on national and regional identities in Europe, comparing the development of nationalism in western countries such as France or Germany with East European nationalism politics in the Russian and Habsburg Empires, and the new wave of ethnic nationalism in Eastern Europe after the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Finally, new trends of populist nationalism and the rise of right-wing nationalist extremism in the wake of the refugee crisis and Brexit will also be explored.

One of the major objectives of this course will be the establishment of a solid theoretical foundation for the study of social deviance.  We will therefore discuss the strengths, limitations, and relevant applications of the positivist and the social constructionist perspectives of deviance.  In the process, students will develop an analytical "tool kit" which will be used to explore a wide variety of deviant behavior.

This course will introduce students to ancient Egyptian religious thought and practice with its massive temples, multitude of gods and goddesses and fascinating funeral rites. We will explore the mythic cycle of Creation and Osirian cycle of betrayal, revenge, death and rebirth, as well as the place of myriad local and minor deities within Egyptian mythology. We will also consider the dynamics of the "monotheistic" revolution of Akhenaton. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Egypt, students will encounter the interaction of sacred and secular, and the relationship between state cults and private worship by nobles and commoners alike. A special feature of the course includes sessions at the Egyptian Exhibit of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and designing public educational materials that will help illuminate this ancient culture.

Operations Management (OM) refers to management of operations of an organization. Operations entail the process of transformation of inputs into outputs using technical, human, and financial resources. For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

TuTh / 08:00 AM-09:15 AM / 02200WWPH


This course is designed to provide students with a sociological perspective on medical beliefs, practices, and delivery systems.  The practice of medicine is embedded in a particular social system, and social factors have an effect on our understanding of illness, the distribution of illness in the population, how/where/by whom medicine is practiced, and also how it is paid for.  In addition, ethical decisions about life and death are based in social belief systems which evolve historically in response to technological developments and changing practice possibilities.  Students in this course will develop an understanding of how medical practices can be interpreted within a social and historical context, and will apply this knowledge to issues which are current in medicine today: the crisis in health care delivery, the effects of technological advances on conceptions of health and illness, the treatment challenge of multicultural patient populations, and ethical dilemmas in medical decision making.

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

Morrill,Michael L

Painting Studio 1 is an introduction to techniques of oil painting and diverse subject matter for compositional development and creative expression. Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting Studio 1. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit. Painting Studio 1 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

By the end of this course you will have a general knowledge of the grammar of the Spanish language and you will be able to communicate effectively in Spanish according to this level.  This course satisfies the foreign language requirement.

This one-credit laboratory course is the first in a two-course sequence designed to be an introduction to scientific inquiry in the biological sciences for majors in biology and related fields. You will work with techniques that are important in biology and apply these techniques to the investigation of basic biological principles emphasizing cell biology and fundamental processes of life. Students should have successfully completed college algebra. If the class is closed when you are enrolling, you should put yourself on the wait lists for multiple sections. The coordinator will not give permission for over-enrollment. While on the wait list, you must attend a lab section during the first two weeks of class so that you are not behind if you get into the class. There is a lab fee attached to this course.

This course will guide students through a common experimental approach that is used in academic and industry research labs.  In the first part of the semester, students will clone genes that have been selected because they are new genes of interest to research labs within the department.  In the second part of the semester, students will express their cloned genes and purify the encoded proteins.  They will use computer analysis to predict possible functions of their proteins and then test their hypotheses using biochemical techniques.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.

This experimental methods course is designed to give upper division majors an opportunity to learn modern techniques used in cell biology research.  Students will master the fundamentals of light microscopy (bright field, phase contrast, and dark field) and explore more advanced techniques such as fluorescence, confocal, video, and differential interference contrast microscopy.  Students will isolate plasma membranes, mitochondria, nuclei, brush borders, and flagella and characterize these organelles by microscopy, enzyme assays and antibody labeling.  Because laboratory exercises are complex, students should be prepared for some classes to extend beyond the scheduled class time.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.

This hands-on course introduces students to key photographic concepts and the basics of shooting and editing film and digital video. It begins with a brief review of the Macintosh Operating System and some of its possibilities. (Students who are unfamiliar with Macs or with computers, in general, may opt to take 'Introduction to Digital' prior to this course.) Students will then work with 35mm still cameras while studying photographic exposure and composition, super-8 motion picture cameras while making short film and mini-dv cameras as they create short video projects. Both film and video editing will be done in a non-linear digital environment. Students will deal with issues such as composition, image sequencing, camera movement, continuity, editing, and time/space manipulation. Instruction will cover the use of equipment and technical basics, but lecturing is kept to a minimum. Basic terms, the development of a visual language and creative possibilities are stressed. All equipment is provided. A limited amount of film and processing is also provided, but students pay for their own videotape and other expenses. Grading is based on student projects as well as written exams. In addition to tuition a $70 course fee will be charged. Must be a School of Arts and Sciences student to enroll.

Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

A scientist announces that the sun contains a new, so far unknown chemical element, even though there is no hope of getting a sample. Another is sure that a famous predecessor has faked his data, even though he has seen nothing but the perfect, published results. Astonishingly, both claims prove to be sober and sound.  We will explore the approaches and methods that make such miracles part of the routine of everyday science. This course is intended for students with little or no background in science.

Traditionally, chemical product design has focused on a set procedure for product development from conception to development and testing and finally the launching of the product.  Unfortunately, this model which does not keep in mind the values or needs of the customer has resulted in a high number of failures for new product launches.  What skills are thus needed in order to be entrepreneurial and succeed in the development of new chemical products within industry today?  This course is the next step in the chemical product design sequence and focuses on chemical product design and the development of business plans.

This course is an introductory survey of methods, theories, and research on the personality and social development of humans from infancy through early adolescence in the United States. This course examines individual development: how people come to be who they are, and how change and continuity work together over time. First comes an investigation of starting points in development. We will study the infant's first social relationship, and we will try to understand the connection between early temperament and mature personality. Basic concepts of developmental theory will also be introduced. Next we examine how children function within increasingly complex and varied social environments such as families, peer groups, and educational settings. Topics covered include self development, sex differences and gender role development, achievement motivation, prosocial behavior/altruism, moral development, and antisocial behavior. This upper level course is designed for psychology majors. the course may be of interest to other advanced undergraduate students who are interested in psychology, child and adolescent development, education, and related disciplines.

A lecture and lab course applicable to students of varied interests.  Lectures cover such topics as skeletal growth and development (from the fetus through aged adult); dental and skeletal pathologies; criteria for determining the sex and age of individuals; the importance of morphological variations as populational markers; skeletal alteration; and lab techniques, such as measuring and reconstructing skeletal remains.  Students must learn the human skeleton in detail. One text will be used.  Gray's Anatomy (now in paperback) or another anatomy text would be a helpful supplement, but none is required. A two part midterm will consist of 1) short essays; 2) identification of skeletal fragments.  The term project, resulting in a term paper, will be the reconstruction and analysis of one or more individuals from excavated burials.  The final exam will be an oral examination based on the project as well as course topics.

This course examines the phenomenon of vampirism in verbal and visual texts from different time periods in various cultures (Russia, Poland, France, England, America). Why do vampires capture the imagination especially of Anglophone readers? What qualities does the vampire incarnate? Which historical events and customs have triggered particular enthusiasm for depicting the undead? How have the depictions of the vampire evolved over centuries? Our discussions will address these issues as we analyze stories, novels, and films focusing on vampires from a variety of critical perspectives, contextualizing the works in the cultures that produced them.

The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to the cultural histories of the Hispanic world, with a particular emphasis on Latin America. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we will study the interaction of social, political, ethnic, racial, and gender dynamics, and the resulting transformations in Latin America, past and present. After a study of pre-contact Iberian and Amerindian societies, we will critically examine the ensuing conflicts that characterized the three centuries of contested colonial rule in Latin America. We will then focus on the different national projects and revolutions that shaped the current geopolitical landscape through both cultural manifestations as well as discourses of national identity and calls for patriotic behavior. We will close with an overview of some of the challenges actors across Latin America face at the turn of the millennium. Throughout the semester, the goal will be both to learn about Latin America and about how it has been imagined by its most influential past and present thinkers, tracing differences and continuities.

Science Fiction
3 cr.
LIT			
Tu / 06:00 PM-08:30 PM / 00349CL


This course introduces students to science fiction as a realm of literary study. Students will engage with sci-fi's major writers, ideas, themes, and forms in order to explore how science fiction developed (and continues to grow) as a genre. Class discussions will help students to understand and use critical methods for the analysis of science fiction. While examining this mode of "popular literature," students will contend with questions of categorization, canonization, and community. "Science Fiction" offers students the chance to consider how an imaginative genre re-presents and extrapolates social, political, scientific, and technological elements of reality.

Oaks, Jeffrey S

This class is about the very writerly practices of introspection and articulation. The main work of the class will be to write daily, the idea behind which is to become more conscious of that inner voice, which is the voice of your obsessions, interests, silences, dreams, hesitancies, weaknesses, strengths, and evasions as a writer. There will be weekly writing prompts to move you deeper into yourself. Central to the work of the class will be your ability to be messy, to trust in your creative process and to allow yourself liberty to say things that might make you feel very vulnerable. Equally important will be your ability to select a page or a couple of paragraphs or a poem to read to the class once a week. At the end of the term, you will hand in a longer piece (10-15 pages) drawn from your daily writing.

Rouse,Roger

The course introduces students to interdisciplinary methods and approaches to "global studies." It draws on case studies of current global issues and trends that require students to think analytically and critically about how we approach, interpret and respond to 'global' phenomena, and about the consequences for different regions, cultures and localities. In this the usefulness, complexity and controversy of the concept of globalization as a key analytical tool is assessed, and students develop an ability to engage with core debates regarding the impact of globalization on culture, economic and social equality, politics and governance, security, and sustainable development.

Our societies face an unprecedented number of environmental challenges. Issues such as climate change, air pollution, and the overuse of natural resources are all threats to our present and future well-being. Looking into the past, humankind has sometimes found a way to tackle these problems, but it has also often failed to do so. Why do we let environmental problems happen? How did we manage to solve some of them? This course seeks to study these questions from a political perspective. We will begin by examining why environmental issues occur in the first place. We will then analyze solutions to these problems, both at the international and domestic levels.

The purpose of this course is to provide you with an overview of some of the classics and new controversies in American politics. We will consider political behavior, political institutions, and the linkages between the two. You cannot expect by the end of the course to have a complete picture of research in American politics, but you will have a taste of some of the areas "Americanists" study. You will also hone your ability to read work in political science with a critical eye and practice synthesizing what you've read to assist you in creating an original research design.

Traditionally, chemical product design has focused on a set procedure for product development from conception to development and testing and finally the launching of the product.  Unfortunately, this model which does not keep in mind the values or needs of the customer has resulted in a high number of failures for new product launches.  What skills are thus needed in order to be entrepreneurial and succeed in the development of new chemical products within industry today?  This course is the next step in the chemical product design sequence and focuses on chemical product design and the development of business plans.

The course begins with Newtonian ideas of space, time, and motion, and outlines the achievements of classical mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory to 1900.  Classical concepts thus introduced, notably the conservation laws of energy and momentum, the field concept, and the wave and particle, are then developed to take account of 20th century relativity and quantum mechanics, in ways that transcend our everyday common-sense understanding of the natural world.  Modern theories of fundamental particles and of the four fundamental types of force are outlined.  Applications to nuclear physics are discussed, in particular methods that show that some objects are billions of years old.  After a brief outline of the physics of stars, the course culminates in recent discoveries about cosmology which demonstrate how remarkably incomplete our fundamental knowledge still remains.

Why do we enjoy making and watching performances? What is it about our brains, our bodies, our history, and our culture that drives us to spend so much of our time engaging with musical events, sports, video games, public speaking, religious rituals, and dramatic programming? And how are we able to shift among so many media (stage, film, television, computers, iPhones, etc.) to sustain and enhance our enjoyment? This introductory course will define performance, explore the roots of its popularity in U.S. history, examine how it engages us through our memories and emotions, and look at its affects and effects on our individual lives and present culture.

This course is an introduction to some of the main figures and problems in Ancient Greek Philosophy. We will read texts spanning from the Pre-Socratics through Hellenistic philosophers, but the majority of our attention will be given to Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Our goal will be to understand not only what the views these thinkers held were, but also why they held them and how they argued for them. When we engage in this activity, we are doing philosophy. So, this course is also an introduction to philosophy itself.

Are you really being as green as you thought? How can technology and the environment survive together? Choices in technology such as telecommuting, electronic books, social media, and cell phones may not be as green as you may think. Some of it is very good, and we will explore the good technology along with the bad. How can computing technology help achieve sustainability such as smart buildings and smart transportation systems. This will be a discussion-based course. Students will be encouraged to describe, interpret, and evaluate the impact of computer technology on the environment. Students will discuss articles, media, and other reflective information to uncover the positives and negatives of computers and technology on our world. As an introductory course, no prior computer experience is needed.

Novosel,Anthony Stephen

A good friend once told me, “People here [Ireland] don’t know history.  They know their “inherited histories.”  These “inherited histories” present us with either a morality play between the native Irish and “perfidious Albion” (England), while another tells us that this is a conflict between the Protestants who settled in Ireland in the 17th Century and the native Irish. Or sometimes the tale told combines elements of both. Which of these “histories” is correct?  Is one and not the other right two?  Are they all true?  Is Irish history a “tragedy” because, as William Moneypenny wrote (1911) it is a conflict “between two rights?”

Intaglio printmaking is an introductory print course offered twice a year. Basic intaglio printmaking techniques are explored through the use of dry point, copper plate line etching, and aquatint. Advanced techniques are explored toward the end of the semester. The course is designed to explore "safe etching" techniques by avoiding or limiting the use of hazardous chemicals. Students will be instructed by demonstration and written instructions on the various processes involved. Students will be required to execute prints in each technique and to print limited editions of each individual work. Grading is based on class participation, creative expression exhibited through the image making of the individual print and the final technical execution of the print. The required editions will be evaluated according to archival standards of uniformity and quality. Students will have the opportunity to make use of professional studio equipment and facilities. This class meets twice weekly and requires considerable out of class studio hours. Regular class attendance is required. There is a $40.00 lab fee.

Gordon,Benjamin Davis

The myths of the ancient Near East are among the earliest written interpretations of the world and human existence. They are also among the most enduring, although they have only been unearthed in the last 200 years. In this course, we read myths from ancient Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and Israel. We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ideas and issues of the original cultural context in which they were shaped. These myths offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient Near East, as well as societal and political issues. We examine themes such as the presentation of the life of the gods, the relationship between the human and divine worlds, the issues of mortality and immortality, existence, fertility, kingship, and ethics. The primary goal of this course is to better understand these myths as they existed and developed in their ancient settings. Of course, because the myths are expressions of human thought, we may find that in studying them we also come to better understand ourselves.

The course aims at providing an overview of the different techniques for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and the structural health monitoring (SHM) of civil and aerospace structures. Techniques such as electrical resistance strain gauges, fiber optic sensing and ultrasonics will be described within the framework of the NDE. Applications to materials characterization and defect detection will be discussed with emphasis on steel and composite structures. Global and local methods for SHM will be introduced with emphasis on vibration and ultrasonic methods, respectively. The course will also provide the essential tools necessary for the digital signal processing of ultrasonic data. Mat lab and laboratory exercises on recent researches will be investigated.

This seminar covers the basic approaches and methods in the study of comparative politics.  By the end of the course you will be familiar with some of the most prominent works in the field and will able to bring new analytical tools into your design of comparative research. The seminar will cover two large themes. First, we will explore some of the most prominent theoretical perspectives in comparative politics: historical sociology, modernization theory, political economy approaches to development and inequality, the study of political culture and civil society, and different approaches to political institutions. Most of the books selected for this seminar are exemplars—models of research that have inspired later scholarly work in our field.  I have made a conscious choice of selecting books over journal articles, since you will read a large number of articles in more specialized courses. Second, the course will deal with methodological questions.  How do we select cases for comparative research?  How do we build analytical categories in order to make comparisons across societies? How should we structure a comparison in order to draw causal inferences? What is the relationship between small-N comparison and large-N statistical work? Since the 1970s, a significant literature in the field has addressed those questions, but over the past two decades, the methodological debate in comparative politics has expanded considerably.

The course intends to provide a broad understanding and appreciation of Africa as a continent, and a home to several societies that have been in existent from the pre-colonial era to the present. It begins, from a theoretical perspective, to debate on the various cultural judgments that have come to globally define the continent and its people. It proceeds to derail this unfortunate geological and geographical features that come to define it as a continent; the multiplicity of people living in it, their external differences in physical appearances, languages, and social organization. It continues with a survey of the political and economic systems that govern the people and the relationship they have with the global world; and their oral, visual and performing arts that are showcased in every event.

In today's marketplace, proposals produce billions of dollars to help solve problems and support causes that people care about. Grant proposals make possible important research in the natural, behavioral, and social sciences; they enable many to benefit from civic and educational projects; and they benefit community development and fund artistic achievement. Other types of proposals allow people to start businesses, create change on the job, and define projects that meet the needs of particular audiences. This course will allow students to understand the functions and conventions of proposals, the types of research that they require, and the processes that generate them and lead to approval. Students will focus on two main issues: developing a proposal (which includes activities such as defining needs, reviewing existing projects and literature, and, if seeking a grant, researching sources of funds) and writing a proposal with a specific audience in mind. Coursework will help students develop an understanding of proposal writing from an initial idea through final submission. Students will complete a variety of written pieces leading up to the final proposal, which may be valuable in their employment portfolios. Upon completion of this course, students will have acquired the research and writing skills necessary to write successful proposals.

Indo-European Folktales

LIT REG

Yanacek,Holly Ann

Since its publication in 1812, the Grimm Brothers' Children's and Household Tales found a readership that spanned countries, languages, and generations. Its universal appeal can be traced to its origins: it reflects not only the influence of early 19th Century Germany, but also oral folklore traditions thatgo back thousands of years and range from as far away as Iceland, the Middle-East, and India. This course introduces students to a wide selection of these and other folktales from the Indo-European tradition as well as to numerous perspectives for understanding these folktales. We will examine the aesthetic, social, historical, and psychological values that these tales reflect, and will also discuss significant theoretical and methodological paradigms within folklore studies, including structural, socio-historical, psychoanalytic, and feminist perspectives. Finally, we will discuss the continuing influence of this folk tradition on popular and elite culture of our time. Two mid-terms and a final exam will contribute respectively 25%, 25%, and 35% to the final grade. Participation in recitation is mandatory and constitutes 15% of the final grade.

The study of others leads back to ourselves. We learn about men and women from the past in order to compare their experiences to our own, hoping that the comparisons will make us more aware of the opportunities and limitations of present-day life. As an introduction to history, this course tries to suggest the excitement and uncertainties of studying the past. We begin in the ancient world and continue through Renaissance and Reformation to the eve of industrial revolution. Students are trained to pose historical questions, to frame arguments about changes in society, and to recognize the limits of historical knowledge.

It will attempt to show how the culture, technology, and ideas of Americans changed over time and describe how these people dealt with these changes. The first section of the course will describe the characteristics of people who lived in a pre-industrial world that lacked not only color TV and nuclear weapons but many of the ideas and organizations that are so important to anyone who lives in the 21st century. The second part of the course will show the enormous technological and economic changes that began to occur in the eighteenth century and that created an entirely new world to which people had to rapidly adjust. The third and final section of the course will show how these changes could not be contained within a political system designed for a pre-industrial society and how the breakdown of that system resulted in Civil War and the creation of a much more centralized nation.

This course allows students to better understand what questions archaeology asks, what kinds of evidence and data are available to archaeologists, and how archaeologists make statements based on the data available.  At the same time, this introductory study of archaeology will allow students to more fully comprehend the connection between the past and the present. The first half of the course, "Ancestral Human Origins, Modern Humans and the Building Blocks of Social Complexity," investigates the evolutionary sequence of ancestral and early human species and the basis for complex social organization.  The second half of the course, "The Development and Rise of Social Complexity," focuses on the development of complex social organizations.

This is a standard introductory course in microeconomics. It focuses on the way the market system works. The decisions of households, firms, and governments are coordinated through markets in which prices adjust to keep buying plans and selling plans consistent. The U.S. economy relies mainly on markets to coordinate these decisions, although sometimes governments intervene. We will explore various social issues using the principles developed throughout the course. Upon completion of the course students will have a better understanding of economic problems, efficiency, laws of demand and supply, consumer choice theory, market organization, production and cost.

Introduction To Literature

What is literature? Is it meant to educate? Inspire? Heal? Entertain? Transcend or confront? Do the meanings found in a literary work come out of the individual reader's knowledge and experience, the author's intentions, or the structure and style of the work? In this course, we will engage such questions while reading a selection of poetry, fiction, and drama. These readings, from various historical periods and socio-cultural contexts, will be the basis for an exploration into the differences-often blurry and changeable-between "literary" and "non-literary" writing. At the same time, as we consider the uses, qualities, and effects of literature, we will examine, apply, and reflect upon a set of strategies for reading challenging creative works.

Chung, Wen-Ting

This course can be defined as the study of the interaction between people, the objects they use, and the environments in which they use them.  In this course, we study all three of these components and especially their interaction in tasks, that is, in the use people make of objects within some environment to accomplish a goal.  This use of objects to accomplish some goal is a special concern of Human Factors: What makes some objects more "usable" than others?  What types of people find particular objects easy/hard to use? How does the environment in which objects are used affect usability?  The purpose of the course is to encourage students to recognize the importance of those kinds of questions, to present some of the techniques used to answer those questions, and to provide a few possible answers.  In particular, this course stresses the role those questions play in good design, in improving the usability of objects, for both "everyday" objects and for modern computerized technology.

This course is designed to provide students with a sociological perspective on medical beliefs, practices, and delivery systems.  The practice of medicine is embedded in a particular social system, and social factors have an effect on our understanding of illness, the distribution of illness in the population, how/where/by whom medicine is practiced, and also how it is paid for.  In addition, ethical decisions about life and death are based in social belief systems which evolve historically in response to technological developments and changing practice possibilities.  Students in this course will develop an understanding of how medical practices can be interpreted within a social and historical context, and will apply this knowledge to issues which are current in medicine today: the crisis in health care delivery, the effects of technological advances on conceptions of health and illness, the treatment challenge of multicultural patient populations, and ethical dilemmas in medical decision making.

The visit of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the United States has attracted major public attention. For Germany is a powerful and reliable European ally of the United States as well as a key representative of the EU.  Germany also plays a crucial part in promoting peace and stability in the world. If you wish to find out more about contemporary Germany in its global and European context join "GERMANY TODAY." This course gives students an insight into the development of German society from the postwar period to the present time. Through lectures, readings, film viewings, and group discussions, the course explores key concerns in German culture: 1. the contemporary political, cultural, and economic situation in Germany; 2. the German parliamentary system and the upcoming elections; 3. contemporary political populism in Europe and Germany versus Germany's attempt to cope with its past: the Nazi dictatorship versus the GDR dictatorship; 4. multiculturalism in German society, in particular a fascinating generation of writers and poets who came from different countries, settled in Germany, and write their works in German.  Among these authors are Herta Müller (Romania), Emine Özdamar (Turkey), Rafik Schami (Syria), Yoko Tawada (Japan) and many others; and, last but not least: GERMAN SOCCER!

TuTh / 10:30 AM-11:50 AM / 00319BENDM


 This course addresses fundamental and practical issues of water resources engineering. The increasing demand for sufficient water quantity and quality that is distributed in time and space forces engineers and policy makers to develop more comprehensive, complex, and ambitious plans for environmental and water systems. This course emphasizes understanding, formulating, and approaches of solving problems of water resources engineering. Quantitative overview of the water resources development, water resources problems, impacts of climate variability and global warming on water resources, and the fundamental principles and basic tools to solve these problems will be covered. Topics to be discussed also include introduction to basic concepts of hydrology, GIS (geographic information systems) applications, theory of unit hydrograph, frequency analysis, flood routing through reservoirs and rivers, introduction to rainfall-runoff analyses, and watershed modeling.

Glover,Geoffrey J

This writing-intensive section of Imagining Social Justice focuses on the evolution of social critique in dystopian literature. Students will define the characteristics, history and purpose of dystopian lit by examining examples of the narrative type written during the Twentieth century. The student will then compare the historical characteristics and purpose with those of dystopian literature written in the twenty first century. The course will end by extrapolating the future trajectory of the narrative type’s social critiques. Paramount to our discussion of the history and purpose of dystopian literature will be questions of how this genre of fiction helps us to imagine social justice, whether or not this constitutes the "work" done by the genre, and how that sense of social justice might have changed over the years. As a writing intensive section, the course will require the student to practice significant levels of writing and revision, as well as basic competency in higher order argumentation skills.

Acting For The Camera

Perry,Dolores R

This course is designed for actors who would like to improve their craft by better understanding the differences between acting for the stage and acting for the camera. It will also be informative for film and television directors who would like to work more effectively with actors. Actor training traditionally uses stage scripts. Reading a film script is a different discipline, requiring an understanding of the process of filmmaking. The course will describe and demonstrate the contrasts between stage and screen acting in specific shooting scripts and follow that with appropriate script study, character analysis and exercise in film acting techniques. Each class will include lecture, videotaped examples of performances for analysis and critique and the practical experience of working in front of the camera. The stage provides an actor with physical space within which to work, but a camera provides framed space that must be experienced to be used effectively. The course will take the student through the process of filmmaking. Film and television scripts will be the principal sources of material for the practical exercises which will be videotaped for playback and critique. Additional requirements include preparation and rehearsal of scenes for taping in the class, outside viewings of film and television programs and written analyses of performances. In addition to the tuition a $35.00 course fee will be charged. Must be a student in the School of Arts and Sciences to enroll.

Perry,Dolores R

Black and White Photography 1 is a practical and theoretical course designed to give an awareness and understanding of the technical and aesthetic implications of photography. It is a production course where students, through a series of lectures and laboratory periods, will learn the process of seeing (making an exposure) and the craftsmanship (making a photographic print) that are the fundamental aspects of photography. The lecture will be divided into three main categories: (1) Techniques: Students will be introduced to the technical problems of photography and acquire an understanding to the practical and theoretical aspects of the camera body, the lens, the aperture, the shutter, and film exposure. (2) Aesthetics: Students will study the theory and psychological implications of their own work and the work of many prominent, contemporary photographers which will be shown and discussed in the form of slides and slide/tape presentations. (3) Assignments: The emphasis will be on the students' individual approaches to specific technical and aesthetic problems. The laboratory period is initially for demonstrating film developing, analyzing the negative, making a print (contact printing and enlarging), and finishing a print (spotting and mounting). Individual attention is also a primary consideration for the lab periods. Students will be expected to spend 2-3 hours per week outside of their lecture and lab periods to complete assignments. A student who wishes to take this course must have access to a 120- or 35mm camera (preferably a manual type which has a full range of aperture settings and shutter speeds), and will be expected to purchase a developing tank, reels, film, and paper. In addition to the tuition a $70.00 course fee will be charged for supplies, chemicals, and use of the facilities. Must be in the School of Arts and Sciences to enroll.

This hands-on course introduces students to key photographic concepts and the basics of shooting and editing film and digital video. It begins with a brief review of the Macintosh Operating System and some of its possibilities. (Students who are unfamiliar with Macs or with computers, in general, may opt to take 'Introduction to Digital' prior to this course.) Students will then work with 35mm still cameras while studying photographic exposure and composition, super-8 motion picture cameras while making short film and mini-dv cameras as they create short video projects. Both film and video editing will be done in a non-linear digital environment. Students will deal with issues such as composition, image sequencing, camera movement, continuity, editing, and time/space manipulation. Instruction will cover the use of equipment and technical basics, but lecturing is kept to a minimum. Basic terms, the development of a visual language and creative possibilities are stressed. All equipment is provided. A limited amount of film and processing is also provided, but students pay for their own videotape and other expenses. Grading is based on student projects as well as written exams. In addition to tuition a $70 course fee will be charged. Must be a School of Arts and Sciences student to enroll.

We will examine communication wherein messages are sent by virtue of our physical characteristics, adornment, facial expressions, eye behavior, design and selection of environments, spatial relationships, utilization of time, touching behavior, body movements, selection of objects to fill space, and vocal behavior. We will do this by discussing material from a textbook as well as by independent research, observation and experimentation.  There will be class activities, written assignments, and class presentations.  There will be three non-cumulative exams as well.  Attendance and participation is NOT optional.

In this course we aim to understand the fundamental structure and workings of modern capitalist society.  We will examine the distribution of wealth, income, and power in both the US and globally, and consider the notions of democracy and imperialism in the context of what we broadly call, “globalization.”  Can we have political equality in societies with high degrees of economic inequality?  Are corporations too powerful?  Whose side does government usually take – the “little guy’s” or the corporations’?  Why?  How is it possible that the richest nation in the world also has more poverty than any other ‘democratic’ country?  We will explore these and many other topics from the macro- to the micro- levels of analysis.

This course is the first of two semester courses that serve as a capstone designed to transition the student from cadet to U.S. Army officer.  Students are assigned to command and staff positions within the cadet battalion, corresponding to those found in United States Army units.  Students perform the duties of the staff or command as assigned and interact with the other cadets as part of a functioning command organization.  In addition to studying the operations and organizations of the U.S. Army, students are required to plan and execute the required training and activities in leading the underclass cadets.  A variety of topics of current interest are covered.  Guest speakers are commonly invited to discuss their military experiences or their perspectives on military-related topics.  Each student must also register for Leadership Lab, participate in physical training, field training exercises and is expected to wear the Army uniform.

Kosters,Daniel L

While this course builds upon the basic concepts and military skills covered in MILS 0011/0012, those courses are not mandatory prerequisites for participation in MS 0021.  In this course, students will delve more deeply into the Army’s leadership and management techniques, including the application of those techniques in faculty-supervised practical exercises.  The course also seeks to enhance the student’s abilities in orienteering and map reading, terrain analysis, advanced lifesaving techniques and physical fitness.  Students are introduced to the values that define the United States Army as an American institution, and each student continues to enhance his or her physical development under the supervision of the faculty.  Each student must also register for Leadership Lab, participate in physical training, field training exercises and is expected to wear the Army uniform, which will be provided.

This research-focused version of BIOSC 0050 uses bacteriophage discovery to introduce biology as an experimental science.  Students learn current laboratory techniques through discovery, isolation, and characterization of their own novel virus.  Students will be introduced to concepts in microbiology, evolution, and molecular biology through hands-on experiments driven by results obtained during class.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.  This course is the first half of a two-part course.  Students who enroll should plan on taking BIOSC 0068 in the subsequent term.  This course is equivalent to BIOSC 0050.

This course will address the principal ethical issues facing print and broadcast journalism. It will consider the practical dilemmas, reporters, and editors have to deal with and relate them to a moral framework. The focus will be on the real time arguments that arise almost daily in media coverage of matters of public controversy – crime, war, privacy, and the like. The course objectives are to learn how to evaluate the performance of the media and to help students develop their own ethical philosophy.

This course examines sports from a social and cultural perspective. We will use sociology to investigate such issues as how sports and sport participation affect our lives, the ritual significance of sports, and the impact sports have our ideas about gender, race, and social class. We will also explore the social and economic costs and benefits of sports, sports as a business, and how sports impact local communities and universities. Finally, we will analyze social problems in sports including violence, drug use, and exploitation.

The first term in a two-term introductory lecture-demonstration sequence in physics for science and engineering students. Calculus is used as needed and should be taken at least concurrently. Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0110,0111 sequence. Subjects covered in Physics 0174 include: kinematics; Newton's laws of motion; energy; momentum, rotational motion, rigid body motion, angular momentum, simple harmonic motion, gravitation, mechanical waves, sound waves, and the kinetic theory of gases. Students planning to major in physics are urged to take the equivalent honors course (Physics 0475). This section will be held in a flipped format. Students will be expected to watch approximately two hours of recorded lectures each week online. The other two hours each week will be spent in the classroom with a focus on demonstrations and problem solving.

Students in this course will culture microorganisms from natural sources such as soil, vegetables, and their own skin, and learn various methods while studying the organisms they have cultured.  The topics for the course include (a) survey of types of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and algae; (b) types of methods used to culture and study these microorganisms, especially bacteria, including aseptic technique; preparation of microbiological culture media; isolation of bacteria from natural source,  and cultivation of various types of microbes; use of microscopes and basic staining techniques; identification of unknown bacterial isolates; and (c) some practical applications of microbiology such as microbiological analysis of wastewater, and identification of clinical isolates. The exercises incorporate practice with (i) data analysis, (ii) commonly used computational skills needed by microbiologists, and (iii) safety practices for protecting the microbiologist, personnel on whom the laboratory depends (e.g. custodian and dishwasher), and the workspace, from microbial contamination. The curriculum includes a variety of standard methods that anyone having such a course listed on his or her transcript would be expected to know. There is a lab fee attached to this course.

The Independent Study option permits students to design courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department writing courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework. Check the individual section to determine whether the section is a 'W' section.

Beaulieu,Julie R

How and why did sex and sexuality become subjects of study? How are our experiences of sex and sexuality shaped by a history of 'scientific' explorations of desire? Why has sexuality become so central to our understandings of identity? What was sex like before 'sexuality' was invented? This seminar explores these questions by approaching sex and sexuality as socially, historically, and culturally contingent concepts. We will consider sex and sexuality as they are related to other categories of identity, including race, class, ethnicity, nation, and ability. Our theoretical and historical investigations will create the groundwork for understanding and rethinking how sexuality is understood in culture today.

Intro To Feminist Theory

Lovett,Matthew T

This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses. Students will have opportunities to apply feminist theories to their work in their home disciplines.

Jenkins,Delanie C

This course partners advanced Studio Arts majors with a faculty member as a teaching assistant in a current departmental course. The partnership is intended to offer further experience to dedicated students exploring a particular media with mentorship in studio management and an introduction to teaching, will enhance the course by offering enrolled students additional support and access for skill development and questions throughout the term, and will offer faculty valuable studio management and assistance in working with students. With the diversity of courses, media, and faculty, each UTA experience will be unique. Given this, there is no official syllabus though a contract (signed by student, faculty member, and department chair) is required in order to gain a permission number to register for course credit. SA 1904 may be taken for 1-3 course credits depending on the level of involvement appropriate to each course and is an upper-level elective that can be repeated in different courses, though only 3 credits may be applied toward elective credit given a student’s progress within the major. SA 1904 is an S/N course (pass/fail - satisfactory/unsatisfactory) and is not taken for a letter grade. PREQ: Minimum of 30 credits already earned in Studio Arts prior to registration.

Visual Thinking is an introduction into the process and practice of making images. The broad scope of the subject is explored through lectures, discussions and critiques. Students are introduced to the dynamics of composition, relationships of form and content, principles of color, aesthetics, visual analysis, perception, and the importance of visual choice, purpose, and creativity in an increasingly image-oriented culture. The course also seeks to provide some experience with a variety of media, develop skills in observation and technique, and encourage personal involvement in solving visual problems. Projects focus on preparation and planning, developing awareness of visual issues, understanding and applying visual concepts, and developing core skills and technique. The course offers a relevant introduction and insight into the process and practice of making art. This course is open to art majors and non-art majors. In-class productivity and participation, as well as significant out-of-class work are expected. The course requires the purchase of art materials and supplies. Due to the nature of studio practice, demonstration, and performance, it is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting. There is a $15.00 lab fee.

This course is designed as an introduction to the visual arts of China. It is hoped that the lecture, class discussions, reading and written work when taken together will provide a base with which you can begin to understand how the Chinese have viewed themselves and the world through time and how this has been expressed in the visual arts.  The chronological principle is used as a framework to organize the course. Within each period the arts are analyzed visually and stylistic and iconographic change are examined in light of social and political context.  The purpose in each section of the course is to learn, with increasing skill, to read the works and to interpret them in their historical context.  Weeks one - four we will look at analysis in an archaeological context.  Weeks five and six concentrate on the religious art of Taoism and Buddhism and their relationship to the state.  The weeks seven - twelve focus on the art of painting and its importance to the court and to the individual.  The last two weeks are designed to look at modern and contemporary China and the attitudes toward formerly elite forms of art vs. art of the common people.

The Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations industry has well documented inefficiencies stemming primarily from fragmentation in the project delivery process. At the same time, the industry faces significant challenges such as the demand to deliver projects more economically, the desire for more environmentally responsible projects, and the expectation of more predictability in performance -- all of which call for more integration and collaboration throughout a project’s lifecycle. New technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) are revolutionizing architecture and construction, providing a platform that allows project information to be captured, structured and analyzed throughout the entire lifecycle of a project, enabling a more integrated, collaborative process that supports more informed decision making and higher levels of efficiency. In this course, students will learn the principles of BIM using Revit software.

Developing a new democracy is a process, with at least two main parts. First the country must move away from authoritarian rule. The first part of the course, therefore, will examine why (or why not) countries make that transition and how they do so. The second part of the course will then examine why some countries are more successful in their transition, based on an examination of civil society and the types of political institutions (such as political parties, the executive system, and the judiciary) that countries develop. What influences these choices and how do these choices affect success and stability of the new democracy? Has international aid been successful in helping countries develop democratic practices?

This is an advanced undergraduate course in feminist economic sociology. We will use concepts, theoretical frameworks, and empirical research to interrogate “gender at work” in two main ways. (1) We will investigate how forces and institutions of political economy (markets, technologies and social relations of production, divisions of labor, etc.) produce and reproduce gender (that is, both difference and dominance organized around masculinity and femininity as natural “opposites”). (2) We will investigate how gender (assumptions and practices of gender polarization, biological essentialism, and androcentrism) organizes economic behavior, organizations, and institutions. The course will be organized in seminar format, with readings and participatory discussions and presentations of material directed toward students’ understanding and critically appreciating the research literature on gender and work.

The University Honors College History of Sports course focuses on the emergence and evolution of sport during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  It looks at the changing nature and meaning of sport, tackling why and how sport evolved from a community pastime to today's corporate money ball, what sport has meant to people in different societies and epochs, and what roles race, gender, and the media have played in sport. It will also look at the global consequences of sport’s current model—that of global capitalism—on youth, play, and the meaning of sport.  It will do so by looking at baseball academies in the Caribbean, football academies in Africa and Europe, junior hockey in Canada, and high school basketball and football in the United States and the South Pacific. The seminar format permits greater student involvement, research opportunities, and participation/discussion. The course asks you to address these questions and topics in seminar sessions as well as in writing about them.  No prerequisites but come ready to explore.

This course explores the tumultuous decade of the 1960s in American society, politics, law, popular culture, and foreign affairs. Usually associated with sex, drugs, and rock and roll, the sixties produced dissent and division among the young and old.  Amidst the groundswell of colonial liberation movements around the world, Americans divided over the legitimacy and morality of overt and covert military operations abroad. Grass-roots mobilizations of African Americans and women for full citizenship rights produced a chain reaction of other discontented Americans. New immigration policies admitting foreign-born peoples previously barred from the U.S. since the 1920s redefined the U.S. population. Not since the 1930s had the federal government issued so many landmark laws expanding education, job training, housing, health care, and welfare. The sexual revolution and new lifestyles challenged notions of “proper” conduct and the meaning of privacy. Throughout the decade political assassinations, urban riots, and a succession of public demonstrations questioned how well U.S. democracy actually worked.

Warren,Tessa C

Course Objective: This graduate course will introduce core issues, theories, and experimental findings in cognitive psychology, with an emphasis on information processing view of cognition. We will investigate the foundational theories and issues as well as the research methods used this area—in other words, how human cognition can be studied scientifically, and why the results of experimental investigations support particular theories. Course Prerequisite: Experience with psychology research methods and at least one psychology overview course Target Audience: Graduate students in psychology or related fields Topics Covered: History/philosophy of cognitive psychology, perception, attention, memory, language, knowledge representation, computational modeling of cognition, cognitive development, reasoning/decision-making, learning and transfer, and individual differences in cognition. Course Format: The course will be a hybrid between a broad overview class and a pro-seminar. A portion of the class will be devoted to going over the readings and answering questions or having discussion about the broad topic of the day’s class. The remainder of the class will be guided by an expert in that day’s specific area and will usually take the form of a lecture or discussion about current research trends/debates in the area. Requirements: For every class period, there will be a set of readings. These will usually include 1-2 chapters from a cognitive psychology textbook (e.g. in the past we have used Cognitive Psychology and its Implications, by John R. Anderson) and 2-3 scientific journal articles related to the topic of the day. Required assignments typically include weekly in-depth responses to questions about the readings, 3 short (4-5 page) papers that relate an article related to your work to topics discussed in class, and a longer final paper. Class participation is crucial to this course, so attendance and participation play an important role in the final grade.

This course will deal with word structure and morphological processes in natural language (inflection, agreement, derivation, compounding, incorporation, cliticization, reduplication). The data to be analyzed will be drawn from a wide range of the world's languages. The relationship between morphology and other components of the grammar (syntax, phonology, the lexicon, pragmatics) will occupy a central place in the syllabus. Finally, considerations of typology, change, processing, and acquisition will be addressed. By and large, the approaches followed will be those of generative linguistics (Lexical Morphology, Prosodic Morphology, Distributed Morphology, etc.). The course presupposes a general linguistics course.

What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework. Check the individual section to determine whether the section is a 'W' section.

Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

TuTh / 06:00 PM-07:15 PM / 0A522PUBHL


This course is designed to help students with weak mathematical backgrounds review algebra. For faster paced or more advanced courses, students who know algebra should consider either Math 0032, 0100, or 0200, which can be used to satisfy the algebra requirement and/or prepare students for calculus. In this course emphasis will be placed on the visualization of algebra concepts with a graphing calculator . Topics include: linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential and logarithmic functions. The instructor lectures three time each week and undergraduate teaching assistants lead problem solving recitation sessions once each week. This course serves as a prerequisite for Math 0120 and, together with 0032, as a prerequisite for Math 0220. A graphing calculator, TI-83 or equivalent, is required. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

This course is designed for those students who have had high school courses, Algebra I, II, Geometry, and Trigonometry, but feel that more preparation is prudent or necessary to enable them to tackle calculus successfully. The following topics are studied: polynomial functions, rational functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, inverse functions, graphs, asymptotes, conic sections, translation and rotation of axes, trigonometric identities and equations, polar coordinates, systems of equations and limits. Emphasis will be placed on visualization of functions with graphing calculators. Students who want a slower paced precalculus course should take Math 0031 followed by Math 0032. A graphing calculator TI-83 or equivalent is required. The instructor lectures three time a week and graduate teaching assistant leads a problem solving recitation twice a week. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

Intro Theoretical Mathematics

W	
MoWeFr / 02:00 PM-02:50 PM / 00627THACK


This "W" course is an introduction to the theoretical treatment of the real numbers, sets, functions, sequences, and limits. Classwork and homework will concentrate on the writing and understanding of proofs of theorems centered on these topics. For most students, the techniques of reading and doing proofs will be new. Two recitations per week, therefore, are required to practice this skill as well as to rehearse the many definitions of mathematical concepts in the course. It is required for all Mathematics and Statistics majors except for Departmental Honors majors who may wish to accelerate by substituting Mathematics 0450 for 0413 and 0420, and then taking Advanced Calculus. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

Granshaw, Michelle

This seminar examines the intersections of transnational and national performance histories during the long nineteenth century and questions the ways transnational and related global methodologies reconfigure our ideas of performance, historiography, nation, race, gender, and queerness among others. How do attempts to de-center US and European-based nineteenth century performance narratives shift our notions of how to research, analyze, and write performance history? In what ways do transnational approaches reconceptualize how we might theorize performance inside and outside of the playhouse? What challenges do transnational and national approaches to performance present when writing about performance’s global circulation? The course will discuss recent nineteenth century Theatre History and Performance Studies scholarship, including work by Elizabeth Maddock Dillon, Daphne Brooks, Marlis Schweitzer, and Tavia Nyong'o. We will consider a range of theoretical and historiographical approaches to performance across North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.

This course will be taught essentially as a literature course; that is to say, attention will be focused on how various authors of classical (chiefly Greek) antiquity used the traditional figures and stories of their culture's mythology in order to say things of lasting value about the conditions and problems of human life.  We shall begin with the emergence of the cosmos as recounted in Hesiod's Theogony and then take up each of the major Olympian dieties in turn, studying the ways in which they are depicted in other works of Greek literature, including the Homeric Hymns, various plays by Aeschylus and Euripides, and Homer's Odyssey.

We will discuss how each author transforms and interprets the myths in accordance with his own methods to these ancient stories as a mirror of the cultural climate contemporary with him. Topics covered include the creation myth of Hesiod's Theogony and the portrayal of the gods of popular Greek and Roman religion through this and other works such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and Vergil's Aeneid. It is the aim of this course to expand the students' understanding of ancient Greek and Roman literary culture and to equip them with a variety of interpretative methodologies.

Lotz,Andrew Louis

This course considers George R.R. Martin’s popular “Song of Fire and Ice”/”Game of Thrones” series in a political context. The class will consider the way that the series speaks to and shapes political attitudes and beliefs, as well as the way that Martin’s creative vision was formed by reference to history and politics. The course will begin with reading Martin’s own writing: the book Game of Thrones. Then it will explore the historical inspiration of the series, the Wars of the Roses, and some of the political theory that was created in reaction to that period. Following that, it will cover a few critical political theorists whose works focus on narratives about power, deception, and authority (the core themes of the series). Students in the class will gain exposure to Machiavelli, Locke, de Montesquieu, and Arendt in the course of this consideration, while also getting a chance to understand and discuss the popular books and television show in academic and sustained fashion. As a note, prior reading or viewing of the series is not required, nor necessary, though it will be helpful (and a spoiler policy will be given before the start of the term to minimize concern for those at various points of encountering the series). Grading will be primarily focused on short reaction papers, in-class writing and recall exercises, and a final argumentative research paper.

In the 21st century, many challenges to public health – including HIV/AIDS, dengue fever, SARS, malaria, “swine” flu, and Ebola – transcend national boundaries and trigger international responses.  Public policy initiatives, non-profit organizations, governmental agencies, and grassroots movements all take aim at global epidemics and health inequalities, but they do so, often, based on widely diverging strategies and goals.  Poor health and the prevalence of particular diseases dominate characterizations of the “global south,” the “Third World,” or “developing countries” in the media, shaping public policy, foreign aid, and wider assumptions about life, health, and human rights.

In ancient China, we have one of the most influential intellectual traditions in all of world history. The ethical and political debates that began in the middle of the first millennium BCE, starting with Confucius, have helped shape the history of East Asia and the world at large. This course introduces students to this intellectual tradition by a close reading of its classic texts. Readings include the Confucian Analects, Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu), Mencius, and Sima Qian’s Records of the Grand Historian (all in translations). We will study the ethical and political ideas in each of these classic texts, the dialogues between them, and the many ways in which they have shaped the history of ancient China and the world at large.

This course will introduce students to the study of Amerindian textualities produced in the vast territories discovered in 1492 and colonized by the Spanish, Portuguese, and English. We will begin by examining pre-Hispanic and colonial artifacts and texts that challenge hegemonic European knowledge with the emergence of non-Western epistemologies (Mesoamerican codices, Navajo dry paintings, first nations sacred books, and colonial writings). In a second approach students will engage in the study of contemporary Amerindian narratives that will connect indigenous textualities to current issues of human rights, national identity, debates about sexuality, campaigns around violence, ideology, sovereignty, and the performance of culture as a site of resistance.  Among the authors that will be examined are: Rigoberta Menchú, Fausto Reinaga, Domitila Barrios, Evo Morales Aima, Julieta Paredes, and Leslie Marmon Silko.

Even before the United States became a nation, authors began writing our collective history, shaping our national memory.  The stories we have told ourselves about the origins of the nation and its literature have been of key importance to the ways we understand our culture, landscape, and identity.  Yet, our "origin stories" are often complex - rife with invention, revision, distortion, and omission.  In this class, we will focus on specific instances of cultural meaning-making (or "traditions") in American literature.  Along the way, we will consider larger questions about the relationship between history, fiction, and experience.

Rogers, Gayle

The forces of globalization press upon our everyday world in often incomprehensible ways.  Things that used to feel local and familiar are now global and dispersed.  Data can travel from Pittsburgh to Beijing and back in milliseconds.  The challenge of trying to make sense of this rapidly changing world—its technologies, its new cultures, its wars and revolutions—has been taken up by authors from around the world.  And these same authors realize, too, that their works have been irrevocably shaped by the forces that are shrinking the planet.  In this course, we’ll read texts that attempt to understand globalization through literary and textual innovations.  We will read new, exciting works from authors both known and unknown, and we’ll put them in dialogue with the reigning debates about globalization.  Can literature change the way we think about war, injustice, or geopolitics?  What constitutes “the developing world” and how have authors depicted it?  How do novels circulate in the global community?  Most important, what modes of analysis do the literatures of globalization require, and how can we use them to interpret our own places in the whirlwind of modernity?

This course is for all students who have an intellectual interest in the complex resources of some of our shared traditions as well as a healthy curiosity about the history of our present. In other words, this seminar will make available a demanding, but still selective encounter with works of high aesthetic, intellectual, and indeed even political importance. It is the assumption behind all humanistic education that citizens, leaders, and intellectuals require for proper civic formation, a thorough study of the most valuable resources that previous generations have left us. While no two-semester seminar can be exhaustive, we feel that a careful engagement with the materials on these reading lists provides far more than a good beginning.

Astronomy 0413 includes an additional 50-minute class section each week. In these extra sections, basic topics will be covered in more detail than in the Astronomy 0113 course. These extra sessions will also involve significant problem solving and discussions of the derivations of fundamental results in astronomy and astrophysics. Students considering a major in physics, astronomy, or physics and astronomy are strongly encouraged to take Astronomy 0413 rather than Astronomy 0113.

This course provides an introduction to the broad sub-field of medical anthropology, including the study of ethnomedicine, ethnopsychiatry, disease and ecology, epidemiology, demography and population growth, development, and the political economy of health care. Our focus will be on the relationship between health and culture in various social contexts, with primary attention given to questions of power and inequality on the one hand, and personhood and emotion on the other. In exploring one or two case studies of ritual healing, we will look at the ways in which medical systems are integrated with larger systems of cultural meaning.  We will also look at various medical systems in a cross-cultural comparative framework.  Following on a consideration of so-called traditional medicine in the non-Western world, we will question the 'objectivity' of Western biomedical science and its various discourses. Extending this critique we will analyze the important relationship between poverty, and the political economy of public health in international development.

Sa / 01:00 PM-04:00 PM / 00363CL


This course attempts to provide an understanding of American post-World War II foreign policy behavior. We will  examine both the international system of which the United States is a component part, as well as attributes of the U.S. domestic scene which influence policy decisions and directions. In the process, the student  will be provided with a general understanding of the chronology of recent international events as well as a feel for the scope and substance of disagreement over various policies. The materials examined for this class  should be suggestive of alternative policy directions for the future.

Anderson,Erin Rose

With the recent podcasting boom, audio has emerged as an increasingly vibrant and viable platform for storytelling across genres—from narrative journalism, to the audio essay, to serial (non)fiction. What can we as writers learn from encounters with these stories-in-sound? How can born-audio narratives help us attune ourselves to questions of style, structure, scene, etc. in unexpected ways? And how might we take inspiration from these forms to reimagine the possibilities of our writing, whether it’s for the ear or for the page? This class will explore the present-day terrain of narrative audio against the backdrop of twentieth-century radio greats. You will produce focused critical responses to weekly listening assignments, engage in (and occasionally lead) rigorous discussions on craft, and generate some of your own creative work in response to the stories we encounter. This class is designed for audiophiles and curious newbies alike. If you’re interested in trying out your writing in audio forms, there will be space to do so. Writers in all genres are encouraged to join.

MoWe / 01:00 PM-02:40 PM / 00B15FKART
Batista,Kenneth

Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

General content, purposes and methods: The course centers on classic texts of world literature, from Homer, to the Koran, to Emerson and Woolf. This course is meant for all students who have an intellectual interest in the complex resources of some of our shared traditions as well as a healthy curiosity about the history of our present. In other words, this seminar is intended to make available a demanding, but still selective encounter with works of high aesthetic, intellectual, and indeed even political importance. We will conduct this course as a seminar using the Socratic Method. Each class, one or two students will give an introduction to that day's reading in order to enable conversation and debate. We will not rely on secondary materials, except in so far as they are essential to placing our authors and texts in their contexts. In order to enrich this course as much as possible, we will arrange related events outside of class time. These events might include showing films, arranging for expert visitors from our campus and other universities, and holding reading or discussion groups in the honors college facilities.

Shin,Seung-hwan

This course examines Korea's social and cultural developments over the course of its modern history. In discussing its history and culture that has been lesser known to the outside world than it should be, this course also aims to help the student gain fresh perspectives on broader contexts such as East Asia and the Pacific Rim. This course spans a wide range of time periods: the colonial period (the late eighteenth century) to the present. Yet designed to inspire critical approach rather than just offer a simple overview, it is structured around key historical and sociocultural issues such as colonial modernity, the Korean War, national division, military dictatorship, democracy movements, national culture, gender politics, diaspora, globalization, and hallyu (the Korean Wave). Intended to be comparative and interdisciplinary, this course also draws on various fields and sources such as history, literature, culture, films, and music.

Independent Study is used only to allow time in the student's schedule to prepare for the Comprehensive Examination or Prospectus Meeting. It is not appropriate to register for Independent Study to complete the requirements for any other course; nor, as a rule, is Independent Study an appropriate option for first- or second-year students (or any other student having many outstanding course requirements). Grading: S/N. Note: for students in composition and theory and historical musicology, no more that six credits of Independent Study may be counted toward the 72 credits required for the Ph.D. degree; for students in ethnomusicology, no credits earned in courses of Independent Study may be counted toward the 72 credits required for the Ph.D. degree.

Centrally located within the Mediterranean, Italy was rich in natural resources, under the firm control of civic elites who managed contacts with other cultural groups. Roman “art”, therefore, was an art of advertisement and consumption—one that served to identify the wealthiest and most influential members of the community and to further their interests.  The course will follow the development of Rome from an aggressively expansive, aristocratic city-state to a socially innovative political conglomerate with control over the Mediterranean world. This development fostered 1) unprecedented economic stability and prosperity across a wide region, allowing objects and styles that were once limited to the elite to “filter down” to a broader range of consumers, and 2) the need for an art that communicated the achievements and goals of the imperial government to different regions and cultures.  This is not a writing course per se, but it attempts, through feedback on a series of short, focused essays, to be written in class and out of class, and a Research Paper, to work with students’ ability to pose problems, work toward a solution, and articulate that process in writing.

This development fostered 1) unprecedented economic stability and prosperity across a wide region, allowing objects and styles that were once limited to the elite to “filter down” to a broader range of consumers, and 2) the need for an art that communicated the achievements and goals of the imperial government to different regions and cultures.  This is not a writing course per se, but it attempts, through feedback on a series of short, focused essays, to be written in class and out of class, and a Research Paper, to work with students’ ability to pose problems, work toward a solution, and articulate that process in writing.

This course offers an opportunity to read, discuss, and write about a wide variety of short stories and their social and historical contexts, beginning with an examination of what contexts we now bring to our readings of short stories: What do we expect a short story to be and to mean? And what historical and cultural influences have shaped our ways of thinking, reading, and writing about short stories?

In this course we will examine the contexts for and rhetorical dimensions of a variety of professional documents, including those documents students produce in the course itself. Major assignments include a set of career materials (resume, cover letter, career report); a correspondence packet that addresses a conflict; a proposal; and a longer report based on research and analysis. As we engage in this work we will explore the nature of professionalism, common features and efforts (enabling and disabling) of professional discourse, and strategies for negotiating the "borders" of specialized and non-specialized discourse.

In the US, the term “public humanities” began to circulate during the 1990s, with humanities centers, public humanities curriculum offerings, and service learning initiatives seeking to reaffirm the value of humanistic study in the wake of the Culture Wars. The first goal of this course will be to survey and make students aware of the scholarly and professional opportunities associated with this public humanities movement, both within universities and beyond. This course will also investigate the concept of the public humanities beyond the contemporary moment, and examine resources for public engagement in various scholarly and historical traditions. Guiding questions will include: what are the humanities and how have they been defined, both historically and analytically? How can they be said to be public, particularly with regard to their existence as university departments? What obstacles and opportunities currently exist for humanities scholarship and its public impact? By pursuing these questions, this course hopes to give students tools for deepening the connections between their work in the humanities and people, places, and issues outside the university. Readings will focus on contemporary debates about the humanities but will also include historical texts.

This intermediate, three hour-per-week course builds on the skills acquired during the first year of study in French 1 and 2, while further developing linguistic and sociolinguistic competence in French.  Because the focus is on communication, the course is taught entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for French 3 are as follows: 1) speak French well enough to ask and answer questions in various situations beyond what is needed to simply "survive" in a francophone culture, i.e., the ability to talk about self and surroundings in some detail; 2) understand enough spoken French to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations related to topics above; 3) read well enough to understand principal themes and most details in simple literary and non-literary texts; 4) write longer and more cohesive paragraphs; 5) cultivate a deeper understanding of French-speaking cultures; 6) gain a better understanding of how French works as a language.

This course is for students who have successfully completed German 0002 or who have placed into the course on the basis of the department placement test. German 0003 will provide students with opportunities to strengthen their listening and speaking abilities and mastery of German grammar, to read a variety of short authentic texts as well as a longer adapted book, and to write longer and more complex compositions than those assigned in Elementary German courses. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. They will also work with web materials, complete a variety of assignments online, and work on a project. Together with GER 0004, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

Course objective: To encourage students to make connections between their undergraduate education in communication and their experience as an intern in the workplace. Special emphasis will be on relating theory to practice in a way that makes students conceptualize their broader education in a manner that makes it relevant and applicable to real world situations. To enroll, students must have the approval of the communication advisor (1122 CL or 1124 CL), be in conjunction with a professional organization, and relate to some aspect of communication. The seminar provides a bridge between a student's undergraduate education and the competitive workplace that they will soon be entering. The purpose is to provide a forum in which the classroom practices of inquiry, investigation, reflection, and oral and written communication become meaningful in the context of work environments, specifically in the communications and media industries. The student must work 12-15 hours per week for 3 credits. Internships receive an S/N grade. Students enrolled in this seminar will meet in person 2-3 times per semester. During the remainder of the semester, students will complete readings and very short written assignments on the class Blackboard site. Students are no longer required to find a faculty sponsor -- Dr. Shuster will serve as the sponsor for all Communication interns.

This is an elementary language course for students who have not previously studied any German. In this proficiency-oriented course students begin to learn how to communicate in German. The course emphasizes all four skills—speaking, listening, reading, and writing – and introduces students to the culture of the German-speaking countries. This course meets five hours per week and gives students a thorough introduction to learning German. By the end of the first semester, they should be able to take the A1-Exam of the Goethe Institut, which follows the Common European Framework of Reference and is accepted worldwide. Students should plan to take German 0002 during the following semester.

Many important phenomena in economics and political science involve strategic interaction among small numbers of agents. Examples include competition between oil producing nations, bargaining over the price of a car, and forming voting coalitions in a legislature. Game theory is the mathematical tool that social scientists use to model these phenomena. This course will provide an introduction to the fundamental concepts of modern game theory and applications to the social sciences.

How can politics be studied and understood "scientifically"?  This course serves as an introduction to the methods of political science research. The course will begin with the logic of social scientific inquiry and the basics of research design, and then introduce students to the quantitative methods that are commonly used by political scientists to investigate important questions about the political world. The goals of the course are 1) to strengthen each student's ability to analyze, interpret, and critically assess real-world phenomena from a social scientific perspective, 2) for the student to become an intelligent consumer of political science research, with the ability to see the strengths and flaws of social scientific studies in academic journals and books, magazines, newspapers, and other media outlets; and 3) to give students the skills necessary to begin conducting original political science research studies of their own.

3 cr.
	
MoWeFr / 09:00 AM-09:50 AM / TBATBA
Jung,Sung Kyu

This course covers the basic topics in the mathematical theory of statistics: parameterized families of statistical distributions (exponential families, location and scale families, etc.); principles of data reduction (sufficiency, invariance, ancillarity, likelihood); methods of finding, evaluating and improving point and interval estimators (Rao-Blackwell method, Cramer-Rao inequality, etc.) and hypothesis tests (Neyman-Pearson Lemma and extensions, monotone likelihood ratio, unbiased and similar tests, etc.); multiparameter statistical decision problems. Both classical and conditional frequentist approaches to inference and the Bayes paradigm for inference will be presented and contrasted. Other statistical paradigms (such as R. A. Fisher’s fiducial probability) will be discussed.  Concepts are illustrated with examples suggested by statistical practice.

In addition to looking at present day variations and their history in this light, we will consider the social use of scientific findings as well as the implications for distribution of disease and pathology.  No text book. Required readings will cover the "classics" as well as current literature.  There are no exams or papers but a final class presentation and an annotated bibliography will be required.

What does it mean to belong, or not to belong? What does it mean to be mobile? What is a home, a homeland, home country, or nation? How do experiences of migration, exile, and displacement shift one’s understanding of home? Warfare, statecraft, and political violence, and recent environmental and social disasters, are giving rise to forms of belonging, mobility, and displacement that do not fit within traditional categories.  War and political violence destabilize national borders while reinforcing structures of power that bolster or mimic nation-state forms.  Environmental disaster and poverty cause displacements that cannot be classified purely in terms of either “economic” or “forced” migration, but produce composite categories which, as of yet, have no formal legal foothold, such as “economic” or “environmental” refugees. While popular culture often heralds the rise of multiculturalism in a globalized world, there are also alarming signals (surveillance, strategies of “profiling,” increasing militarization of borders, and race-related violence) that suggest that ideas of blood and territory continue as powerful delineators of inclusion and exclusion.  This course asks how belonging, mobility, and displacement take shape amid political violence; global migrations of people, capital, and ideas; social inequalities; new forms of political organization and governance (international, grass-roots, supranational); and the continued dominance of nation-states.

India is many things.  Since independence in 1947, India has developed from an overwhelmingly agricultural and traditional society that was not able to grow enough food for its 325 million population, to an increasingly urban, developed society of 1.1 billion that exports food along with a wide range of products and services, including cutting-edge high-tech ones.  The Indian middle class is growing rapidly.  India is also the world’s largest democracy, and has dealt, very substantially though not in full measure (to cite first Prime Minister Nehru) with the complexities of a multi-religious, multi-ethnic, and in all other ways extraordinarily diverse society – there are 22 official languages in use in the country. This course will focus on contemporary Indian social and cultural formations, after reviewing the development of the country and those formations since independence.  Topics to be covered include religions and the interactions of religious communities in a secular state; caste and other principles of social distinction; gender; regional identities; socio-economic development; the rapid development of communications over the past two decades; and the intertwining of all of these factors in democratic (or at least electoral) politics.  Since the instructor went first to India as an undergraduate student in 1971 and has remained fascinated with the country ever since, the course will necessarily also note changes in the ways India has been studied over the past forty years.

Undergraduate Seminar. This course fulfills the anthropology writing course requirement.  It introduces students to different types of anthropological and ethnographic writing and allows students to “try on” different anthropological writing styles and theoretical approaches.  We will read empirical writings (structural functional ethnographic realist writing) that characterized anthropological work through the 1960s.  We will explore interpretive writing, influenced partly by Clifford Geertz, followed by a range of experimental, reflexive, and critical writings associated with the “experimental moment” of the late 19080s.  Readings will include examples of feminist ethnography and fictional ethnography (or ethnographic fiction).  Throughout the class we will consider the poetics (writing style) and politics (forms of power) implicit in various forms of ethnographic writing by anthropologists and others.  Students will have the opportunity to emulate and evaluate different writing styles.  The course will be highly participatory and will involve seminar discussions of readings, of student experiences and observations, paper presentations, and class feedback on papers.  Several short papers will be required and one longer final paper that builds on the shorter ones.

Barton,Loukas William

People have used stone to accomplish many different things for a very long time. Today, archaeologists study prehistoric patterns of stone tool production and use to track, understand, and evaluate the evolution of human behavior, cognition, and social organization around the world. This class will explore theoretical and methodological approaches to the analysis of stone artifacts, including chipped, ground, and polished tools as well as the by-products of their manufacture, for the purpose of revealing human behavior from the Lower Paleolithic to the recent era. Topics will include debates over tool form and function, questions about human mobility and trade, recent advances in the scientific approach to materials identification, the history of creative experimental replication, ideas about the nature of innovation and social learning, and a foundation in both lithic raw materials (obsidian, flint, slate, etc.) and stone tool typology (arrow heads, hand axes, metates, etc.). Two primary objectives will cross-cut all of our explorations: 1) understanding how to read behavior from patterns in archaeological data, and 2) gathering insight on the nature of technological evolution across different time scales.

Lovett,Matthew T

This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses. Students will have opportunities to apply feminist theories to their work in their home disciplines.

1-credit Lab: ENGLIT 0699 30285. The Anatomy Lesson is an attempt at a truly interdisciplinary study of the medical/anatomical body in historical and cultural context as it has been presented in works literary, artistic, historical/archival, and scientific.  Anatomy emerges from obscurity with the work of Andreas Vesalius in the sixteenth century, becomes a necessary part of the education of every citizen in the European Enlightenment, and retreats into the realms of specialist medical knowledge in modernity.  Taught by a cultural critic (Jeff Aziz) and an anatomist (Jason Dechant), this course will examine how evolving anatomical knowledge informs changing cultural perceptions of the body and our embodied humanity.  Critical objects will include Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, A. S. Byatt’s Angels and Insects, the anatomical works of Andreas Vesalius, Bernhard Siegfried Albinus, and Frederick Ruysch, as well as artistic representations of anatomical practice including Rembrandt’s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp.  This course will include a required laboratory component in which students will work with anatomical materials including human cadavers, gaining a fundamental knowledge of human and comparative anatomy.  This University Honors College course is open to students who have an overall GPA of 3.25.

This course is inspired by the Secret [city name here] series of travel books that pride themselves on being “local guides by local people.”  As such, the class offers you the chance to embrace the viewpoint of these books by striving to “look more closely at the urban landscape and to see your own city with the curiosity and attention that we often display while travelling elsewhere.”  We’ll be visiting sites (parks, museums, industrial remains, etc.) all over Pittsburgh, learning how to “read” and record the places we visit. We’ll draw on literature (fiction, nonfiction, and poetry) and cultural theories of space, representation and archiving to frame our on-site experiences in writing and in digital forms.  We’ll also be testing how the skills of a literature classroom translate to these “real world” urban explorations.  The final project will involve assembling a multi-authored on-line guidebook to Secret Pittsburgh.

This course will focus on the beginnings and early years of the African American Literature.  We will examine the early influences on the novel, its first, pre-emancipation examples, and its development during Reconstruction and the gilded age. This approach necessitates that we focus on a wide range of materials including slave narratives, folk tales, abolitionist literature and the bible as well as the novels themselves. Our goal is to develop a sense of the roles played by political, literary, cultural and historical forces on the development of the early African American novel. We will then position these 19th century examples in the African American literary tradition as a whole.

Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

As a field of research, language and gender studies is interdisciplinary and relatively new. These studies seem to discover the nature of gender-related differences in language and their causes and effects. Gender here refers to social categories based on sex but encompassing behavior, roles and images that, although not biologically determined, are regarded by a society as appropriate to its male or female members. What is seen as appropriate to each gender thus differs in different societies and eras. Explanations for gender thus differ in different societies and eras. Explanations for almost all observed male/female language differences are to be found less in the biological constitution of the human body and more in the social and psychological formation of the human subject. These are the issues we will be concerned with in this course. Is women's language use in systematic ways different from that of men? If it is different, how is it different? Why is it different, what sorts of explanations are there? And maybe most important, does a difference of language use matter? Requirements: Assigned readings. Weekly journals. Midterm exam. Final exam. Presentation of research proposal and written research report. Fulfills General Education requirement.

Korean 1 is the beginning course for those who have NO prior knowledge in Korean or who hear and speak Korean for the FIRST time. This course is designed for students to learn 'standard Korean', that is the spoken and written forms of Korean used by educated Koreans. This course is aimed for basic conversational fluency, to acquire reading skills and to learn grammatical structures and writing skills at the simple sentence level, and to learn basic listening comprehension. Topics such as greetings, talking about school and work, time and days of the week, daily life, past and future weekend activities will be covered throughout the course. Korean 1 classes are divided into two parts: Lecture classes will include important information and explanations of those conversational patterns in grammatical and pragmatic terms. The course also provides sociolinguistics and socio-cultural information especially when language is intimately linked with culture. Recitation classes will provide the students opportunity to practice strictly in Korean with various tasks and activities in most essential daily life situation. This means that students are expected to use the target language as much as they can throughout the course. Students will often be asked to make a pair or a small group in which they may interact with each other verbally. Students are expected to memorize the frame dialogues, vocabularies and expressions assigned by lesson with the help of CD-ROM in the Language Media Center (G17 CL) or on-line web site of the textbook and the workbook.

For hundreds of years, the majority of Jewish life happened in Yiddish. On the eve of World War II, eleven million Jews spoke this rich, Slavic-infused Germanic language. Even after undergoing the demographic devastation of the Holocaust and experiencing marginalization of all kinds, Yiddish has survived as a linguistic chain that connects modern diaspora Jewry to centuries of Jewish civilization and culture. In addition to serving as a link to the Ashkenazic (Central- and Eastern European) Jewish past, Yiddish is key to some of the most exciting creative developments in Jewish life today. This course will serve as a lively introduction to Yiddish language and culture. By the end of the course, students will have the reading proficiency to work with basic Yiddish texts, and will be able to understand and conduct simple conversations. Students will learn the basics of Yiddish grammar and will be conversant in Yiddish culture, both past and present.

Furthermore, the curriculum is designed to deepen the students' knowledge of Korean language and culture by exposing different speech/written styles, various expressions, vocabulary, structural patterns, Korean proverbs and idioms. Hence, it is catered for learners who have taken at least two years of Korean language or have a fairly good knowledge of intermediate Korean. The course is divided into two parts in which the Lecture Class focuses on acquiring the complex grammar patterns, building more sophisticated vocabularies and expressions, improving writing skills and writing/recognition of the Sino-Korean words whereas the Recitation Class focuses on developing advanced and intellectual speaking not only in interpersonal, but also in interpretive and presentational communication through a wide variety of interesting authentic materials.

Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

This course explores the nature of political parties in the United States. We will learn about the history of elections, the current state of party politics, campaign finance, the role of parties in government, and the evolution of the political campaign. The course pays particular attention to the double-edged sword of parties’ current role in American politics. Primary questions we will engage include: Why do party leaders make the decision they make? Why do voters follow party leaders’ cues? Is there any hope to overcome the partisan gridlock that seems to undermine good governance?

Media And Politics
3 cr.
	
TuTh / 04:00 PM-05:15 PM / 00337CL


For many, the dramatic growth of the mass media has caused politics to become something of a spectator sport rather than an opportunity for direct personal involvement. New media now provide the critical linkage mechanism connecting government leaders and their constituents. Additionally, the citizen’s understanding of political phenomena increasingly is affected by the interpretations of social and political affairs offered by popular or non-news media. This course will examine the significance of media, with particular emphasis on media in the United States. We will consider what social scientists have discovered regarding the political implications of current media practices, what possibilities exist for media reform, and what long term consequences active media bring for the workings of democratic governance.

This course tackles the big questions of Chinese politics. What is “China”? How did China enter modernity? Why was there a communist revolution? What legacy does it leave for contemporary politics? How and why did China’s Communists embrace capitalism? What are the sources of social and political changes in contemporary China? What are the bedrocks of and challenges to the CCP’s legitimacy? In our effort to understand how China’s unusual and opaque political system works, we will first survey the development of Chinese politics from the Maoist era through the 1989 student uprising in Tiananmen Square. Then we will focus on contemporary politics, exploring the changing fault lines in Chinese politics between different classes, genders, and ethnic groups, among others. Finally, we will turn to the question of China’s future. Will the regime continue to adapt? Is political reform likely to lead to some kind of revolution? Or democratization?

Architecture: Image, Text, Theory is an upper level writing intensive [W] course required for all students wishing to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a major in Architectural Studies. The objectives are to acquaint students with architectural themes in various literary genres, to examine the emergence and development of core ideas in the Western architectural tradition, and to understand the relationship between architectural ideas and the contexts in which they were articulated. Texts examined in the course will include classic architectural treatises, texts on landscape, urbanism and aesthetics. Drawings, engravings, photography, and illustrations will be considered as important components of architectural theory; the format and composition of architectural books will be considered as integral to the ideas they contain.

Mackenzie,Michael Kenneth

Democracy is a centrally important concept in political science. Those who wish to study almost any aspect of politics — from election campaigns to domestic policy processes to international relations — will, at some point, be expected to articulate a theory of democracy. Even those who study authoritarian regimes often use democratic regimes as counterpoint examples. In short, a well-rounded political scientist must know something about both democratic institutions and democratic theory.  This course aims to provide students with an appreciation of the varieties of democratic thought, a knowledge of the great debates in the field, and a sense of how democratic ideals have been approximated in institutional forms.

The first half of the course will cover the highly influential works of John Rawls as well as reactions from Robert Nozick, and Susan Moller Okin. The second half of the course will weave in the issue of globalization to questions of justice—again using Rawls’ work and various respondents as a vehicle for doing so. The course ends with a significant applied project on the intersection of globalization and justice that will challenge students to consider the current state of justice in a particular global case of their choosing.

This course explores the conditions that lead to initiation of domestic armed conflicts.  Why do civil wars break out in some countries but not others? We will examine factors such as inequality, state capacity, ethnicity, and regime type as potential causes of civil wars. We will also discuss why some civil wars last longer than others and the determinants of the severity of civil wars. The ultimate goal of this course is not to examine a particular civil war in detail but rather to provide a broad theoretical treatment of civil wars, and a better understanding of international relations. Upon completion of this course, you should be familiar with the factors that mitigate or exacerbate conflict within states.

The basic concepts of local quantum field theory will be built up in a systematic way from the fundamental constraints of Lorentz invariance, unitarity and clustering of the scattering matrix. The construction will be illustrated first in some simple scalar theories. The concept of spin at the particle level will be shown to lead to the introduction of covariant fields. Discrete symmetries (parity and charge conjugation) will be discussed. The incorporation of parity requirements for spin 1/2 will be shown to lead directly to the Dirac formalism. The general structure of perturbation theory (Wick's Theorem and Feynman rules) will be derived, with some examples from QED. The basics of renormalization theory will be illustrated (scalar field theories only). The course will conclude with a discussion of field theory in Heisenberg picture and the use of Lagrangian methods to manifest space-time symmetry.

Pickett,James R

Over the last several centuries, Eurasia’s domination by successive nomadic steppe empires (stretching from Europe to China) was displaced by new imperial challengers from the periphery (notably Russia, China, and Britain). This course examines the nature of that transition by charting the history of Eurasian empires, beginning with the Mongols in the thirteenth century and proceeding through the present day. From Ghenghis Khan to Tamerlane to Stalin; between Russian spies, Chinese armies, and the Taliban; spanning silk roads, great games, and more. The empires of the steppe were truly vast in scale, integrating territories usually studied in isolation from one another, and so this course provides important context for separate courses on Russia, Eastern Europe, China, and the Middle East. The chronological scope of this course is similarly epic, spanning over seven centuries, and thus placing in relief recurring themes related to empires in world history. The thematic emphasis is on geopolitical strategies for imperial rule, but the course will also examine culture, religion, and political economy.

In this course we will explore how gender shapes our lives and the world around us. The course treats gender as socially constructed, context specific, and malleable, rather than biologically determined. Drawing on a wide variety of scholarly and popular readings and media, this course pays particular attention to power, privilege and oppression by examining how gender intersects with social class, sexuality, race, ethnicity, ability, and size. Although the primary context for this course is contemporary American society, issues and examples from other cultures will be introduced. The course is designed to challenge conventional understandings of gender and gendered behavior, and to highlight the larger power structures in which this behavior exists. Students will learn to think critically about gender, to employ this knowledge in writing and discussion, and to apply these concepts to their own social worlds.

From Puritan attempts to control women’s sexuality to contemporary debates over reproductive rights and gay marriage, religion and sexuality have played a formative role in American political and social history. Though political ideologies have often tried to situate both sexuality and religion as private matters that have no bearing on public life, the topics we discuss in this course reveal that quite the opposite is true. We take a chronological approach to our subjects, locating the intersections between religion and sexuality throughout the course of American history. In the process, we’ll discover how competing ideas regarding religion and sexuality have transformed, and continue to transform, politics, culture, and society in the United States.

This course will survey the major achievements of ancient Greek civilization. Arranged on a roughly chronological basis, the readings and lectures will move from the epic poetry of Greece's heroic Bronze Age, through the great intellectual innovations of the Archaic Age, to the Classical era dominated by the contrasting contributions of Sparta and Athens. Although the social and economic background will not be neglected, the chief emphasis will be placed on those aspects of Greek civilization that have retained a perennial significance for Western societies— its literature, its politics, its historical writing, its philosophy, its art and architecture.

How can we best communicate with others in order to persuade them? How can we promote a position or product while maintaining high ethical standards? Advertising and fundraising require the same kinds of persuasive work, though they serve different rhetorical contexts; advertising takes place in for-profit settings, while fundraising takes place in nonprofit settings. Both attempt to influence the decisions people make about the money they spend, the attitudes they have, and the issues that shape our society. In this course, students will analyze and create the kinds of persuasive writing used in the fields of fundraising and advertising. Coursework will involve readings, discussion, brief papers that analyze and critique work done in the fields, a presentation to the class, and an original written project that can become part of a student's portfolio to show prospective employers. Students will have opportunities to have their work reviewed in class, to participate in discussions with people currently working in the fields, and to revise their written pieces for a final portfolio.

In this course emphasis will be placed on the visualization of algebra concepts with a graphing calculator . Topics include: linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential and logarithmic functions. The instructor lectures three time each week and undergraduate teaching assistants lead problem solving recitation sessions once each week. This course serves as a prerequisite for Math 0120 and, together with 0032, as a prerequisite for Math 0220. A graphing calculator, TI-83 or equivalent, is required.

In deciding how to act, we frequently guide ourselves by general principles, which forbid or require various kinds of action. Moral philosophy is the attempt to explore systematically a number of questions which arise in connection with such principles. We may ask, for example: What is it for a principle to be a moral principle? Is there one uniquely correct moral code, or is morality a matter of personal preference? What candidates for moral principles can be defended? Why should I be moral? The course will examine several of these questions and the answers suggested by classic moral philosophers such as Kant and Mill. We will also consider discussions of these issues by contemporary philosophers, as well as a concrete moral problem such as abortion. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on learning how to criticize and evaluate moral and philosophical claims, as well as developing and deepening one's own views. By examining the nature of morality, we can better decide how to live. Description from a previous instructor.

This course is designed to provide students with a sociological perspective on medical beliefs, practices, and delivery systems.  The practice of medicine is embedded in a particular social system, and social factors have an effect on our understanding of illness, the distribution of illness in the population, how/where/by whom medicine is practiced, and also how it is paid for.  In addition, ethical decisions about life and death are based in social belief systems which evolve historically in response to technological developments and changing practice possibilities.  Students in this course will develop an understanding of how medical practices can be interpreted within a social and historical context, and will apply this knowledge to issues which are current in medicine today: the crisis in health care delivery, the effects of technological advances on conceptions of health and illness, the treatment challenge of multicultural patient populations, and ethical dilemmas in medical decision making.

This course is intended to expose students to issues regarding the social and ethical implications of technology. In recent years, many computer professionals have become increasingly aware of the societal impacts of the increased use of computer technology in everyday life. While technology promises many benefits to our society and economy, there are also well founded concerns that serious problems may arise. This course is intended to introduce students to the main issues surrounding the computerization of society, and to help students understand the development, application, and consequences of information technology as social as well as technical processes. Topics include computerization and the quality of work life, unemployment, personal privacy and freedom of information, ownership and rights to software, and the manageability, risks and accountability of complex systems. The course seeks to foster in students a critical approach to the understanding of the impact of technology in society via the academic skills of reading, writing and argumentation.

Caribbean History is an undergraduate course that introduces students to conceptual, comparative, and integrative issues of the Caribbean. To gain a deeper understanding the Caribbean’s complex history and its global connections, we will explore indigenous and African enslavement, degrees of freedom within slave systems, rebellion and revolution, paths to emancipation, post-emancipation societies, anticolonial and social movements, postcolonial identities, and contemporary migration. In addition to discussing assigned readings and primary documents and linking those materials to contemporary news on the Caribbean, students will complete a series of assignments with the goal of producing a short critical analysis paper, and present their findings. The syllabus, select readings, and additional resources are accessible on CourseWeb. This course contributes to the curriculum of Africana Studies, Global Studies, and Latin American Studies, along with a number of other majors, minors, and certificate programs.

This course is designed to enhance student understanding of the source of diversity, strengths, and vulnerabilities of African American families. Toward this end, we will (a) provide a historical context for evaluating contemporary African American families; (b) examine the origin and diversity of intimate relations characterizing African American couples; (c) explore the basis for strengths and vulnerabilities characterizing diverse family structures; (d) identify how African value, spiritual, and cultural orientation in face of oppression may enhance quality of life in individuals, families, communities, and society; and (e) examine how cultural oppression compromises standards of ‘truth’ and ‘justice’ in ways that undermine the well-being of African American families.

This course introduces students to the archaeology of China from the Upper Paleolithic to the Han Dynasty (c. 33,000-220 BCE). It is focused around several major topics.  One is the development of key technologies in East Asia—such as the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence agriculture and animal husbandry or the innovation of metallurgy.  Another is the long trajectory of social change from small foraging bands through initial sedentary villages and more complex social organization to very large and powerful states and empires.  Yet another is how the study of Chinese prehistory has contributed to modern notions of a uniquely ‘Chinese’ culture.

Sustainability is a term that has many meanings, depending on who's using it, and we will cover most of them in this class, from green campuses to green-washing.  The class features guest speakers from the academic, governmental, nonprofit and business sectors to offer as many perspectives as possible on sustainability topics.  The real focus of the class, though, is the development of sustainability projects on campus and in the Pittsburgh community.  Students also participate in sustainability-related events and field trips with the opportunity to present their work to a larger audience at the end of the semester.

The Black Church
3 cr.
	
 / - / TBATBA


This course will examine The Black Church within the broader context of the African American religious experience in the United States. We will survey and analyze the development of the Black Church from its historical roots and earliest manifestations through its development into contemporary institutional forms. We will study its historical and theological development by examining the variety of its distinctions, praxis, experience, outlook and historical personages through critical consideration of various readings, lecture and class discussion. The role of black churches in establishing and providing connectivity and community in black life will be examined as well as the trends toward new expanded roles for the Church in an increasingly technological and non-religious oriented age. A critical reading of texts, class discussion and written reflection and analysis will be fundamental to our approach.

Cities are imagined as places of opportunity and indeed they are for some. Yet, for other urban dwellers, cities are places of broken promises and generational poverty. This seminar examines a diverse array of contemporary and classical sociological research to investigate how urban policies shape the opportunities available to city residents. Using the city of Pittsburgh as a living laboratory, students will be asked to attend events and patron establishments in various neighborhoods. Students will analyze their experiences in light of the class materials. Additionally, students will complete an empirical research project for a local organization. This project will include operationalizing research questions, collecting data, testing hypotheses and producing a report. Through class readings, discussions and assignments, students will be asked to wrestle with the question: How can cities strive to be places of promise and possibility for all?

This course is designed to guide students through the design and evaluation of a hypothesis driven research project in the area of comparative and functional genomics of bacteriophages.  In the first half of the course the students will learn methods of sequence analysis and comparative genomics while working with genomes of recently sequenced bacteriophages.  Based on the comparison of closely related bacteriophages they will propose hypotheses about which genes are or are not essential for phage growth.  In the second half they will perform a series of experiments in which they will test these hypotheses using novel recombineering techniques including generation of phage gene knockouts and/or introducing non-sense mutations within gene coding regions.

Aziz, Jeff

It is no easy thing to explain why the thirty-seven plays of a particular Elizabethan playwright have become the paragon of English letters.  However it may be, the works of William Shakespeare have become something of a measure of intellectual credibility.  At the very center of HBO’s recent Westworld series is the cryptic quotation from Romeo and Juliet, “These violent delights have violent ends.”  This course will be a general introduction to the work of Shakespeare, both in historical context, and in its critical and popular reception.  We will explore questions of dramatic representation, history and anachronism, and the strange interminglings of the comic and tragic forms.  Works examined will include The Taming of the Shrew, Richard II, The First Part of Henry IV, Titus Andronicus, and Hamlet.  A particular interest of this course will be the nature of dramatic character: how the persons of the stage were understood in an iconoclastic age that had otherwise turned away from the visual arts.  This University Honors College course is open to students who have an overall GPA of 3.25.

If “botany” is the study of plants, and “ethno” botany is the study of how people used plants, then “paleo” ethnobotany is the study of how people used plants in the past.  People have been using (and consuming) plants in most every part of the world for most of their evolutionary history, yet for most of this time no records were taken.  One of the only ways to learn about prehistoric plant use is through experimentation.  In this course we will conduct a variety of creative experiments to improve our understandings of how people might have collected, processed, consumed, and manipulated plants in the past, and how these different activities might have produced remains that we can collect, record, and analyze with archaeological methods.  The course will be a mixture of classroom discussion, lecture and presentation, outdoor field activities, and laboratory sessions.  Assignments will include independent field and laboratory data collection and experimentation that may include wild and/or domestic plant cultivation, harvest, processing, and storage; simulated combustion, decomposition, and other post-depositional modification of plant parts; and the post-recovery microscopy, dissection, and biogeochemical analysis of them.

Gender is a key structuring principle of difference and inequality in society, while globalization is a condition characterized by time-space compression and ever-expanding connections across national boundaries. Globalization emerged out of such (and often violent) practices of contact as capitalism, colonialism, socialism, the Cold War, and neoliberalism. This course will explore the intersection of gender and globalization asking how gender shapes processes of globalization and how the role of gender is shifting as national/cultural regulatory systems are no longer able to maintain control over what is recognized as “normative” in the context of gender roles and gendered practices. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this course will draw on a range of materials including scholarly texts, fiction, and film to examine various facets of the interface between gender and globalization in such contexts as labor migration, gendered labor in transnational factories, maritime trade, and the high-tech industries, marriage and family, sex and colonialism, sex work and state violence, new reproductive technologies, as well as queer identities and activism. The particular historical contexts in which we will discuss these themes include colonialism, the Cold War Era, post-socialism, and neoliberalism.

This course will survey the major achievements of ancient Greek civilization. Arranged on a roughly chronological basis, the readings and lectures will move from the epic poetry of Greece's heroic Bronze Age, through the great intellectual innovations of the Archaic Age, to the Classical era dominated by the contrasting contributions of Sparta and Athens. Although the social and economic background will not be neglected, the chief emphasis will be placed on those aspects of Greek civilization that have retained a perennial significance for Western societies— its literature, its politics, its historical writing, its philosophy, its art and architecture.

This class is designed to offer students an introduction to the basic nature of society through the relationship between society and the individual. Students will be able to identify classical theories (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, feminist theory) and research methods (quantitative and qualitative) that sociologists use to understand social structure and interaction as well as contemporary controversies (Black Lives Matter, Immigration, Culture, Media) around various forms of social inequality and social change. Through lectures, discussion activities, writing assignments and class presentations, students will be able to develop skills that will help them familiarize themselves with the content. Knowledge gained in this course will benefit students in future studies and within their careers. This course encourages the development of critical thinking about issues occurring in society.

This hands-on course introduces students to key photographic concepts and the basics of shooting and editing film and digital video. It begins with a brief review of the Macintosh Operating System and some of its possibilities. (Students who are unfamiliar with Macs or with computers, in general, may opt to take 'Introduction to Digital' prior to this course.) Students will then work with 35mm still cameras while studying photographic exposure and composition, super-8 motion picture cameras while making short film and mini-dv cameras as they create short video projects. Both film and video editing will be done in a non-linear digital environment. Students will deal with issues such as composition, image sequencing, camera movement, continuity, editing, and time/space manipulation. Instruction will cover the use of equipment and technical basics, but lecturing is kept to a minimum. Basic terms, the development of a visual language and creative possibilities are stressed. All equipment is provided. A limited amount of film and processing is also provided, but students pay for their own videotape and other expenses. Grading is based on student projects as well as written exams. In addition to tuition a $70 course fee will be charged. Must be a School of Arts and Sciences student to enroll.

Why do we enjoy making and watching performances? What is it about our brains, our bodies, our history, and our culture that drives us to spend so much of our time engaging with musical events, sports, video games, public speaking, religious rituals, and dramatic programming? And how are we able to shift among so many media (stage, film, television, computers, iPhones, etc.) to sustain and enhance our enjoyment? This introductory course will define performance, explore the roots of its popularity in U.S. history, examine how it engages us through our memories and emotions, and look at its affects and effects on our individual lives and present culture.

As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

Climate change is one of the most serious threats to the global economy. At its root, problem of climate change is closely related to other issues in environmental economics. Climate change is primarily the result of a negative externality imposed by use of carbon-emitting products and production technologies. However, it presents some additional complications. The consequences of climate change are long-term, uncertain, and global. This course will use tools familiar to economics students to provide them an understanding of the problems and potential solutions to climate change. It will also help students build skills reading, researching, and writing within the field of economics.

This seminar will consider ordinary or everyday language, variously defined.  Why “ordinary” language?   You cannot have a career in teaching without spending your time with (and standing in relation to) what many would define as the ordinary, the common, the everyday.Ordinary language is what stands before or outside language that is literary, elevated, specialized, technical, professional, official, sanctioned, approved—you can extend the list for yourself.   The ordinary stands as a point of reference.   It is often figured as a starting place and seldom as a goal.

3 cr.
HS COM			
MoWeFr / 11:00 AM-11:50 AM / 00239CL


This course is a historical introduction to the religious traditions that developed in ancient Near East and the Mediterranean. Our major emphasis is on the history of the religious traditions that emerged in late antiquity in this area and which continue to be major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Zoroastrianism. We focus on key concepts, historical developments, and contemporary issues. Throughout the course, we also examine interactions among these religious traditions. In the last part of the course we examine the issue of globalization and the spread of these religions around the world as well as the presence of "non-Western" religion in the "West." The course also serves as an introduction to the academic study of religion and provides a foundation for further coursework in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. No prior knowledge of any of the religions studied is expected or assumed.

Works of science fiction are often criticized based on the expected scientific validity of the scenarios they portray. Many celebrated science fiction writers conduct rigorous research in areas such as physics, military theory, economics, and engineering in order to give their stories greater plausibility. However, this type of rigor is relatively rarely seen in the field of linguistics. This is a particularly surprising oversight given the degree to which many of the most awesome tropes in science fiction – including aliens, robots, and time travel – are concerned with linguistic questions. We will apply current linguistic theory to various works of science fiction in order to establish a better understanding of the relative plausibility of varying depictions of these tropes. In this course, we will investigate such questions as: How would we expect to communicate with aliens or machines? What would an alien species sound like? What types of changes can we expect to happen to languages over coming centuries?

This course examines the always intrinsic interactivity between critical theory and creative writing, in relation both to broad historical “movements” and to individual creative enterprise. We will focus on multiple genres, including hybridic forms, at two specific historical moments: the 1970s-80s, when postmodernist critical systems emerged in concert with reconfigured genres on the creative side; and right now, as alternatives are taking their place in both arenas.  In the latter case, your own writing and that of your mentor-models, both creative and critical, will be among our subject texts. This course is designed for entering MFA students.  More advanced students and students in other graduate degree programs will be admitted if there is room.

Campbell,Lori M.

This course studies J.K. Rowling’s famous boy wizard and his world, its contexts, and its impact. The course follows the story arc, character and magical-world construction based on considerations of genre (low fantasy, children’s literature), culture (race, class, gender, ethics, politics), and universal experience (love, death, heroism, child-adult relations, coming-of-age).  Readings include comparable novels by authors other than Rowling, as well as scholarship on the Potter series and on the phenomena rising out of it, not only in terms of controversy such as the attacks of the religious right, but also in the social and political activism of the Harry Potter Alliance, the creativity of fan fiction and wizard rock, and the uses of social media.  You will be expected to synthesize the critical readings with your own reading of the fiction to formulate your ideas in class and in your written work.  In addition to studying the series in terms of its own embedded politics and symbolic meanings, we will also to tackle the larger issue of the book as a cultural construct, and the more difficult question of where to place Rowling and her writing in literary history, i.e. to what extent (or not) the series can be viewed as a “classic.”

Many important phenomena in economics and political science involve strategic interaction among small numbers of agents. Examples include competition between oil producing nations, bargaining over the price of a car, and forming voting coalitions in a legislature. Game theory is the mathematical tool that social scientists use to model these phenomena. This course will provide an introduction to the fundamental concepts of modern game theory and applications to the social sciences.

Topics In Comparative Politics
3 cr.
	
TuTh / 01:00 PM-02:15 PM / 04625WWPH


In this new course, students will explore the ways in which the social, political and cultural construction of sexual difference influences the nature and practice of political life in the Middle East. The course will examine both theoretically and empirically the ways in which power is gendered and how gender has served as a basis for political organization, the distribution of power, and the boundaries of public life. Many themes will be examined in the course to understand the political and economic context of struggles around gender issues; mobilization of women’s movements; the interaction of religion, law, and their interpretation; the gendered nature of the state; the path dependence and institutional nature of women’s movements and struggles; the gendered aspects of revolution, Westernization, secularism, globalization, and socialism in the Middle East. Although the focus of the course will be on the “political” in the context of political science, it will also draw heavily from the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, women’s studies, and political economy. The focus of the course is on the geographic area of North Africa and the Middle East. Intentionally, the course includes a balance between empirical knowledge of particular cases and theoretical debates on gender and politics. Students will be expected to master both theoretical and empirical dimensions of the course. This will culminate in a two-day simulation and debate.

Intro To Feminist Theory
3 cr.
PH W			
TuTh / 09:30 AM-10:45 AM / 00121CL
	 Skoczylas, Marie Bernadette

This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses. Students will have opportunities to apply feminist theories to their work in their home disciplines.

Introduces students to the challenge of managing in complex contemporary environments. The course is team-taught, reflective of the breadth of issues that underlies the business curriculum. A team-based and experientially focused emphasis is designed to promote student awareness of real-world business developments and develop practical skills as well as fundamental knowledge and abilities. The intellectual core of the course will emphasize a holistic and strategic inquiry of the driving forces of competitive markets, the importance of history, the complexity of resource allocation under uncertainty, and the need to develop firm-specific capabilities that are flexible and responsive to changing situations. Attention will also be paid to the construction of criteria for firm success that reflect the complex interactions of ethical, societal, legal, and economic demands. Considerable time will be devoted to the study and analysis of companies.

This course will provide the student with a solid understanding of macroeconomic theory and ensure that the student can apply macroeconomic analysis to the study of economic problems. The course covers the development of modern macroeconomic theory, including classical, Keynesian, monetarist and new classical views of the macroeconomy. Key areas to be covered include theories of business cycles, employment, inflation, economic growth and macroeconomic policy. Particular attention will be given to the role of money in general and monetary policy in particular. Considerable emphasis will be placed on analysing the strengths and weaknesses of these models and understanding how they differ. Students are required to have successfully completed introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics courses before enrolling on this course. Knowledge of elementary calculus is required.

Advancd Theory And Methodology

Mo / 03:00 PM-05:30 PM / 01627CL
Kirk,Keith Byron

 This graduate level course explores the status of cultural memory as an object of investigation in critical theory, as a contested form of social, cultural, and political practice, and its multiple manifestations in varied forms of performance. We will engage with the existing dialogue and debate of what Andrew Hoskins describes as, “…theoretical, empirical, and methodological issues central to a collaborative understanding of memory today” in multiple contexts. These studies will be coupled with an exploration of memory-based practices as well as history and responses to instances of cultural trauma as lenses into the viewing of culturally charged narratives of both social and theatrical performance. We will also analyze how social practices of remembering and forgetting arise and gesture towards the construction and maintenance of community, group, and individual identities. Along with theoretical and methodological readings case studies will be drawn from multiple sources which engage varying narrative structures specifically as sites of memory. (Ex: Narratives of Atlantic and African American slavery, Japanese internment narratives, the Jewish, Bosnian and Rwandan War Genocide narratives, forms of culturally based representation, and political forgetting.

This course introduces students to science fiction as a realm of literary study. Students will engage with sci-fi's major writers, ideas, themes, and forms in order to explore how science fiction developed (and continues to grow) as a genre. Class discussions will help students to understand and use critical methods for the analysis of science fiction. While examining this mode of "popular literature," students will contend with questions of categorization, canonization, and community. "Science Fiction" offers students the chance to consider how an imaginative genre re-presents and extrapolates social, political, scientific, and technological elements of reality.

The Independent Study option permits students to design courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department literature courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

The independent study option permits students in good academic standing to design Public and Professional Writing (PPW) courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. The independent study must integrate both the theory and practice of some aspect of public and/or professional writing, and the student must conduct research that will allow him or her to contextualize the writing forms and content being studied. Students typically write at least 30 pages (or 7,500 words) over the course of the term, and revision plays a significant role in the student's work. In addition, the student and sponsoring faculty member define a reading list and other required research, which may include interviews or surveys. The student and faculty member will agree on other work, such as essays or documents and a journal or other response to the research. Whenever possible, the student will create a final document that can be used by an intended audience or in a professional portfolio. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is comfortable with the subject matter of the study and has worked with the student in the past. The specific form for requesting this faculty approval can be obtained from the Director or Associate Director of PPW in M-2 Thaw Hall. The form requires a description of the project you are proposing, what you expect to learn from it, the reading and research you will do, the products you will create as a result of your study, and the ways in which your sponsor will engage with your work. You should expect to meet with your sponsor at least eight times during the term. Please note that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

TuTh / 04:00 PM-05:15 PM / 00363CL


This course is an examination of a broad  range of social theorists, whose ideas have influenced sociology.  We will read selections of some of the major works of both classical (principally Marx, Weber and Durkheim) and contemporary theorists with the goal of understanding and critically assessing their leading ideas.  Part of this effort will be the task of understanding how the ideas of these thinkers arose in specific social and cultural contexts (i.e., what social problems they thought they were addressing) and in specific intellectual traditions (i.e., what preceding ideas they were borrowing from and bending to their purposes).  The course readings and lecture discussions will also emphasize the continuing relevance of these ideas by examining how they are used (in various modified forms) in some current examples of sociological research.

The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

Transformations in the status, appearance, and meaning of artworks during the European Renaissance have profoundly affected Western visual culture. This course explores the extraordinary experiments of competitive, innovative artists and patrons, going beyond stylistic change to focus on the role of artistic invention in shaping Renaissance society. It considers the shifting functions of the visual arts in Europe between 1250 and 1600. Artists to be discussed include Giotto, Brunelleschi, Donatello, van Eyck, Botticelli, Mantegna, Leonardo, Durer, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian. Students will be asked to write short papers on thematic issues throughout the term and, at the end of the semester, they will undertake a more substantial project that engages the research methods of art history.

Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting 0120. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit from the University of Pittsburgh Bookstore. Painting 0120 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work and in regard to the departmentâ€™s policy on attendance. There is a $15.00 lab fee.

Foundation Drawing is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing 0130 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work and in regard to the departments policy on attendance.

Climate change is one of the most serious threats to the global economy. At its root, problem of climate change is closely related to other issues in environmental economics. Climate change is primarily the result of a negative externality imposed by use of carbon-emitting products and production technologies. However, it presents some additional complications. The consequences of climate change are long-term, uncertain, and global. This course will use tools familiar to economics students to provide them an understanding of the problems and potential solutions to climate change. It will also help students build skills reading, researching, and writing within the field of economics.

Students in this course will encounter, discuss, interpret, and analyze articles, songs, video, films, literary excerpts, and other authentic texts, leading to both a greater understanding of contemporary Italian culture and a greater mastery of Italian forms, vocabulary, and expressions. Special attention will be paid to vocabulary-building exercises, strategies for the focused and efficient reading of texts, and carrying out different kinds of reading for different purposes. At the same time, students will continue to develop their oral proficiency in Italian by discussing and analyzing broad contemporary topics, as they emerge from the course's assigned readings. This class is conducted entirely in Italian.

Are interest groups vital or vicious? Do interest groups use money to ‘buy power,’ or do they play a key part in the representation of diverse ideas? What roles do, and should, interest groups (i.e., special interests, pressure groups, lobbyists) play in democracies? This course explores the role of interest groups in the participation and representation of citizens in the United States. Focusing on key themes like liberty and equality, the course examines what interest groups are and what they do. The course also focuses on important implications of interest group activity: what laws get passed, what politicians get elected, and what groups are heard in the political process.

Sex, Race, & Popular Culture

Popular culture is often defined as a collection of ideas, images, beliefs and practices that have become an essential component of peoples' daily lives. While popular culture is dismissed by some as merely a mass consumer culture, others acknowledge that contemporary popular cultural forms may, in keeping with a history of once contemporary popular art, culture, and literature (e.g. Dickens, Warhol, etc.) Come to be understood as essential, canonical and elite. Ultimately, these materials may be read as a texts that inform our understanding of culture and social life and prompt such questions as: how does popular culture (re)construct our sense of "ordinary" life as something extraordinary? Why are some cultural forms dismissed and others more readily accepted? What social processes bring cultural forms into the public domain? This course will examine popular culture in a variety of forms such as: music, art, television, collectibles, internet, and social media. Students will consider examples from Western, non-Western, and "global" culture, but will use sex and sexuality, gender, and ideas of race to understand the relationship between popular culture, material culture, representation, and consumerism, and power and resistance. It will also address these phenomenon over time. This course will make especially strong use of contemporary and popular media such as video clips, internet media and images, and music.

Authoritarian Politics

Ding,Yue

According to the Democracy Index, only 19 countries are “full democracies,” housing only 13% of the world’s population. Countries like Japan and the United States are considered “flawed democracies” while the majority of the world’s political systems are either “hybrid” or “authoritarian.” Therefore, if we want to truly understand politics, it is essential that we understand politics in non-democracies, or political systems conventionally referred to as “authoritarian regimes.” This course invites students to think critically about the nature of authoritarian political systems. We will examine how society and politics are organized in authoritarian systems and explore fundamental questions about democratic and non-democratic politics. How should we define democracy and authoritarianism? Is liberal democracy the inevitable outcome of social modernization? If so, what transforms societies into democracies and what sustains the resilience of non-democracies? Are certain cultures more prone to authoritarianism? Is authoritarianism good for economic development? How does the abundance of natural resources like oil hinder democratization and undermine democracy?

How and why did sex and sexuality become subjects of study? How are our experiences of sex and sexuality shaped by a history of 'scientific' explorations of desire? Why has sexuality become so central to our understandings of identity? What was sex like before 'sexuality' was invented? This seminar explores these questions by approaching sex and sexuality as socially, historically, and culturally contingent concepts. We will consider sex and sexuality as they are related to other categories of identity, including race, class, ethnicity, nation, and ability. Our theoretical and historical investigations will create the groundwork for understanding and rethinking how sexuality is understood in culture today.

This seminar investigates the convergences and divergences of feminist, queer, and trans childhood studies across the humanities and social sciences via a central question: what kind of cultural and biological form is a child? We will define “childhood” capaciously, including infancy and adolescence, while also considering forms of infantilization at all ages. The course will begin by reconsidering the unusual relationship between gender oppression and childhood in 1970s feminist writing. To complicate that foundation, we will also consider the racialization of childhood as its unthought ground. We will then examine a range of methodological approaches to thinking about children and childhood broadly, and girlhood and boyhood specifically, including history, literature, sociology, education, and anthropology. One focal area of the course will be transgender children and transgender childhood. We will also work to provincialize the Anglo-American narrative of “modern” childhood by reading global and transnational scholarship in childhood studies. The writing in this seminar will ask students to rethink the place of the child in their home discipline and their own scholarship, and final papers may be on a topic from students’ home disciplines.

This course is an introduction to theories of how people think about and enact genders and sexualities. The course edicts both the assumption that people are naturally or normally heterosexual and the idea that being seen as "normal" should be the political or personal goal of sexual minorities. The course calls into question the idea of normal exploring how gender aims to ""normalize"" people by categorizing them. In recognizing the ruse of normality, the course examines sexual practices and gender expressions not attempting to dignify, deny or apologize for them.

Although childhood is often conflated with a biological category based on an immature body, in reality it is much more. Instead, this course examines the ways in which childhood is a discursive and continuously shifting category, one that changes across time and place. This course will introduce students to the study of children and childhood in a cross-cultural context and will pay particular attention to the ways in which notions of childhood, and the experience of being a child, draw from and reproduce understandings of gender and sexuality as they intersect with race, class, ethnicity, etc.  Through readings, lectures, and films, we will also consider the meaning of gendered childhoods in light of contemporary forms of  conception, children’s culture (media, toys and artifacts, stories), child labor and play, and ritual and coming of age ceremonies. An analysis of these contemporary phenomenon highlight local and regional notions of childhood and their intersection with broader global patterns.

The aim of this course is to explore the nature of the phenomenon known as “foreign policy,” which refers mainly to the orientation and actions of nation states toward their external environment.  In recent years that environment has changed dramatically, posing new challenges for states large and small alike.  This course will focus primarily on the world’s major powers but will intersperse a discussion of these states’ foreign policies with consideration of how the nature of their power, as well as the milieu within which they act, has changed.  At the same time, we will also look at the way in which foreign policy can be studied in an attempt to expand our ability to deal analytically with this form of international behavior.

Eastern Europe has now seen more than twenty-five years of dramatic, and uneven, changes away from one-party dictatorship and state-run economies to democratic politics and market economies.  These changes have affected and been affected by developments in Europe, including Russia, Euro-Atlantic relations and international relations more broadly.  The aim of this course is to explore the background and dynamics of the remarkable changes in "the other Europe."  The course will move quickly over the history of the region generally referred to as "East Europe" and will focus primarily on contemporary developments.  A particular focus of the course is the impact on the region of developments elsewhere, especially in the politics and policies of outside powers, and the ripple effect of changes in the region on European and world politics.

Oil and other natural resources have played a crucial role in shaping the politics, development, and foreign relations of countries in all regions of the world. While experts originally believed that natural resource wealth would be a blessing for endowed countries, we now know they often impede economic growth, reinforce authoritarianism, exacerbate corruption, and cause conflict. This course will examine the political economy of oil, natural gas, minerals, and other natural resources to gain insight into why they can be a blessing or a curse. We will explore the role of governments, oil companies, OPEC, the demand for energy security, and environmental concerns in shaping the effects of natural resources.

Oil and other natural resources have played a crucial role in shaping the politics, development, and foreign relations of countries in all regions of the world. While experts originally believed that natural resource wealth would be a blessing for endowed countries, we now know they often impede economic growth, reinforce authoritarianism, exacerbate corruption, and cause conflict. This course will examine the political economy of oil, natural gas, minerals, and other natural resources to gain insight into why they can be a blessing or a curse. We will explore the role of governments, oil companies, OPEC, the demand for energy security, and environmental concerns in shaping the effects of natural resources.

This course surveys the main currents in American political thought from the Puritans to the present.  The survey centers on the theme of freedom, both in its historical and theoretical dimensions.  We study how the concept of freedom has evolved over the past 400 years, paying particular attention to its distinctive religious origins in American ideology and to how a “classical conception” of freedom has worked to include and exclude various people and ideas at various times.

Berkowitz,Daniel Michael

Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them; and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

Krause,George

This PhD. Seminar course examines both the theoretical and empirical literature on the U.S. executive branch.  The focus of this course is strictly centered on the study of political institutions and organizations – political behavior related topics (e.g., presidential popularity; presidential elections; presidential nominations) will be covered in other American Politics field courses.  Although the primary focus of this course will be at the U.S. federal level, some attention will be given to the U.S. subnational level (i.e., American states).  The course is broken down into three sections. The first section provides an overview of inter–disciplinary research on new institutionalism and organizations from economics, sociological, and organization science theoretical traditions.  The second section of this course focuses on the internal functioning of the executive branch, including, but not limited to, president–agency relations. The final section focuses on analyzing executive branch actors’ external relations with other institutional actors (i.e., legislative, judiciary, organized interests) within a separation of powers constitutional framework.

Civil war is one of the most common forms of political violence in the contemporary world. This course will introduce graduate students to the origins and dynamics of civil wars. We will examine the extent to which ethnicity, economic development; state capacity, natural resources, and regime type contribute to the outbreak of civil wars and explore how rationalist approaches explain the onset of civil wars. The second part of the course will focus on the dynamics of civil wars, including explanations for the variance in the level of violence and diffusion and duration of civil wars.

Democracy is a centrally important concept in political science. Those who wish to study almost any aspect of politics — from election campaigns to domestic policy processes to international relations — will, at some point, be expected to articulate a theory of democracy. Even those who study authoritarian regimes often use democratic regimes as counterpoint examples. In short, a well-rounded political scientist must know something about both democratic institutions and democratic theory.  This course aims to provide students with an appreciation of the varieties of democratic thought, a knowledge of the great debates in the field, and a sense of how democratic ideals have been approximated in institutional forms.

This course aims to provide students with an overview of statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of longitudinal data, or data collected on multiple units (individuals, states, dyads, countries) at more than one point in time. The course will focus on models for the analysis of “panel data,” which (by convention) is used to describe data with relatively large number of units and relatively few time points. We will cover different approaches to the analysis of panel data, including structural equation models, fixed and random effects models, dynamic econometric models, and longitudinal hierarchical growth ("multi-level") models.

This is the second course in the department's graduate formal theory sequence.  We will survey game theoretic models in political science with two goals in mind: (1) students will become critical and competent consumers of formal theory and (2) they will be prepared to begin using formal theory in their research.  Topics include bargaining, coalition formation, lobbying, delegation, reputation, and signaling.  We will also discuss the connection between formal models and empirical tests (both observational and experimental) as well as survey alternatives to rational choice (behavioral, computational, and evolutionary models).  Students must be familiar with basic game theoretic concepts and analysis (at the level of PS 2703).

Introduction to the evolutionary history of our species, Homo sapiens, beginning with understanding our place among monkeys and apes, the diversity of our now extinct closest relatives, and, eventually, their – and our – possible evolutionary relationships.  In order to pursue this topic properly we will delve into the areas of comparative anatomy, geology, and paleontology, as well as evolutionary theory, especially the concept of “species” and figuring out evolutionary relationships. Lectures will rely heavily on slides and weekly handouts. There will be three exams.  All will be based on T/F, multiple choice, fill-in, and “identify this structure or specimen” types of questions. The final grade will be based on these exams, (e.27%, 27%, 27%), as well as attendance in lecture and recitations, participation in recitation, and performance on quizzes (19%).  Students must enroll in a recitation section which serves as a forum for review as well as for the presentation of information complementary to the main lectures.  This material will be included on exams and quizzes.

Have you ever wondered exactly how archaeologists examine bits of stone and pottery to understand how people lived in the past?  This course provides you with basic skills in analyzing lithics (rocks) and pottery so you can understand how artifacts were made and used. You will learn how to tabulate data and make interpretations about the activities in which people were engaged based on their material culture.  Classes will include lectures, discussions of readings, assignments, and lots of hands-on experience working with material culture that archaeologists find most often.  Students will also work on a research project analyzing materials from an Iroquois village site occupied in the 16th century.

Undergraduate Seminar. From the traditional head-hunting raids of indigenous Southeast Asia to the military campaigns of states, warfare has played a double-edged role: it destroys individuals and families, but it is also central to society, defining gender roles and group identities, justifying political hierarchy, and supplying a potent source of violent images and narratives to be interwoven with culture.  This undergraduate writing-intensive seminar examines selected current issues in the archaeology of war.  Topics include the causes of war at multiple scales of analysis; the origins of war in human prehistory; cross-cultural variation in the practice of war; relationships between warfare and political power; and the effects of war on the individual and society.

Paleopathology is the study of the disease process among ancient peoples that synthesizes the primary evidence from archaeological, clinical, ethnographical, and documentary sources. In this advanced ‘methods’ oriented course students will be introduced to the epidemiology of disease processes that are identifiable from archaeological skeletal remains, such as dental disease, osteoarthritis, trauma and chronic infection.  Students will learn how to recognize abnormal bone, differentiate between disease processes, evaluate recording methods, write a skeletal report and investigate the social history of these disease processes.  The impact of disease upon the individual and their social identity will be considered throughout the course.

Undergraduate Seminar. Violence between members of different ethnic religious communities within what had been nation states is increasingly common: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, to name just a few current cases.  Yet such violence is not new – in the past century alone, it has occurred in many countries throughout the world. This course examines the logic and frequent tactics of such violence in Europe (Greece/Turkey 1923, Cyprus 1974, Yugoslavia 1941-45 and 1991-95), south Asia (India/Pakistan 1947, India since then), the Middle East (Israel/Palestine; Syria) and Africa (Rwanda/Burundi), among others.  We will pay particular attention to links between religion and conflict, and to gendered patterns of violence.  Most readings are ethnographic, close analyses of cases; but comparative frameworks will also be developed.  I assume no special knowledge by students of any of the case studies before the course begins.  By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of contemporary cases of violence, and also of the common features of such violence in the modern period.

Family relations are a human universal, with many variations around the world.  Family ties are a part of our individual identities and our emplacement within the communities of which we are a part.  Family or kin are often the first to assist in contexts of crisis and Natural Disasters; they are central in situations of Conflict, Violence, and Peace-Making; and kinship ties are constituted everywhere by Rituals of belonging.  Kinship and The Family is therefore an important arena of study on an interdisciplinary basis, for example in Sociology, History, and Politics, as well as being central to contemporary Anthropology.  This course will give students tools they need to study kinship and also to understand its significance in the world today, giving students he tools to understand new phenomena relating to gender and identity.  Same-sex marriage, and LGBTQ issues, as well as reproductive technology and how it intersects with kinship at large.

The purpose of this course is to explore rhetoric and culture through the lens of memory. Collective memory, as the phrase suggests, is the discursive group activity of interpreting the past.  It is a misconception that we “have” memory; memory is something that we “do.” Just as all the memories of my life make me who I am, the collective memories of a culture enact a shared purpose, continuity, and identity. The course is divided into units, all combining readings on theory and practice, surveying the functions of memory, public memory, memory in popular culture and media, epideictic rhetoric’s role in memory, etc. In addition to exams, students write a detailed analysis of an artifact or specific ceremony/ritual/tradition of their choosing illustrating the memory of a community.

Of particular importance will be the role that race, class, and gender have played in shaping consumer culture (and vice versa), as well as the significance of the shift from a society based on an understanding of citizens based on democratic practices to one based on consumerist practices. One lens through which we will examine these issues is youth culture, and how youth identity formation is impacted by consumer culture.

Early twenty-first century celebrations and denunciations of so-called “new media” too often ignore the variety of ways in which “old media” were once themselves new. Indeed, much of the scholarly and popular arguments about digital technology—to take the most recent new media moment—sound suspiciously like arguments made about the radio and the telegraph before it, as well as about the transition from oral to written culture. This course will interrogate these arguments by looking at the longer history of new media encompassed in the tradition of “Media Ecology.” Heavily influenced by the work of Marshall McLuhan—who drew upon the earlier work of Lewis Mumford and Harold Innis—Media Ecology places the technological medium of communication at the center of its scholarly inquiry.  The theorists read and discussed in this course both support and challenge this tradition of thought, exploring a range of ways in which communication technologies interact with, shape, and are shaped by cultural processes.  Readings will be drawn from the work of such writers as Mumford, McLuhan, Innis, Friedrich Kittler, Vilém Flusser, Carolyn Marvin, Elizabeth Eisenstein, and Walter Ong.

In the networks of digital culture, participants collectively generate an understanding of what it means to make cultural artifacts (text, music, imagery, code) and to have expertise. In this course, we explore the rhetoric of interpretation and self-governance that sustains the digital commons. This course begins with a survey of scholarship on the digital commons—the aggregate of persons, resources, and norms that constitute 21st century network culture. Students examine the political and ideological foundations and ambitions of the concept of the commons, especially as a complement to the concept of the public, a key term for both audience and sociality in rhetorical studies. Reflecting the course grounding in rhetorical criticism, our focus will be on critical attention to the symbols of making and knowing, and indeed, being, a member of the digital commons.

The term “Applied Anthropology” emphasizes the practical application of anthropology’s theories and methods to the needs of communities, organizations and institutions to solve real life problems, and formulate and evaluate policy.  This course explores applied anthropology as a subfield of anthropology, but also as a critical component of work for most contemporary anthropologists. Anthropology has been an applied discipline since its inception.  Anthropologists interested in influencing real world challenges have developed a body of substantive work in applied settings, much of which is not published, but recorded in results monographs, reports, and memoranda; and a set of research skills that both includes and goes beyond many of the standard research methods used in conventional ethnography.  Individual applying their training in anthropology across a number of careers can be found in research settings outside the academy, in corporations, think tanks, community organizations and in NGO, government, and corporate staff and management positions.  There are professional organizations, journals and training programs that focus on applied research and program management. At the same time, theory, concepts, research tools and management training has moved from applied setting back into the academic arena and have redefined the way we think about anthropology and its place in the world.  This course will review the history of applied anthropology, review key part of the substantive literature on the work of applied anthropologists, demonstrate and provide opportunities to practice key methods used in investigating real world issues for program development, management, evaluation and policy formation.  We will also spend some time in exploring the range of careers open to applied anthropologists, and the training, career development activities, resume formation that can lead to those careers.  We will review several projects in depth and bring in guest speakers. We will carry out several small research activities/projects aimed at identifying issues for research   researching, and analyzing data and making policy and program recommendations.

Beginning as early as 10,000 years ago human communities of unprecedented scale began to emerge in many regions all around the globe.  The process has continued in much more recent times as well.  These large communities, numbering at least a few hundred people, and ranging well up into the thousands, usually (but not always) became supra-local in character.  Unequal, or hierarchical, relationships usually (but not always) came to occupy an important place in their social organization.  The seminar will take a comparative approach to the social dynamics of this process, using the varied trajectories of chiefdom emergence in different parts of the world as an opportunity to increase our understanding of the forces that have driven this process and given the resulting societies such highly varied characteristics.

A graduate course intended as a workshop for refining papers for publication as journal articles or edited book chapters.  The course is intended for relatively advanced graduate students who have a good idea at the outset of what they plan to publish and have the support of their advisor in the plan.  We will go through the process of identifying suitable publication venues, revising drafts and figures for publication, and understanding what to expect from the peer-review process.  Because the class involves substantial peer feedback, students are asked to commit to supporting their fellow students’ revision process as well as devoting time to their own.  The aim is for every student to submit a paper for publication by the end of the semester.

The primary goal of the Physical Anthropology Core course is to equip all graduate anthropology students with a broad background and understanding of the historical development of the method, theory and diversity of physical anthropology. We begin with our own body to understand role of genetics and epigenetics in shaping human plasticity, disease, growth and development; we then apply these concepts to forensic anthropology, paleopathology and bioarchaeology. The second half of the course traces the human lineage and behavior from the earliest human adaptive markers ~7 mya to the final migration to the New World, with a focus on current debates. Topics will be examined through journal articles, lecture, seminar, lab and case study exercises.

This course is an introduction to varied facets of the discipline of cultural anthropology, stressing the development of the literature as learned discourse.  Emphasis will be placed on major theoretical models and concepts that have been central to the development of the discipline, and on the ways that theoretical paradigms have developed and declined.  The course is intensely interactive, with participation in discussion expected from all students.  Since the core course functions as a departmental qualifying exam, grading is on the basis of a blindly-graded exam at the end of the term. This course is intended for first-year graduate students in the Department of Anthropology.

If “botany” is the study of plants, and “ethno” botany is the study of how people used plants, then “paleo” ethnobotany is the study of how people used plants in the past.  People have been using (and consuming) plants in most every part of the world for most of their evolutionary history, yet for most of this time no records were taken.  One of the only ways to learn about prehistoric plant use is through experimentation.  In this course we will conduct a variety of creative experiments to improve our understandings of how people might have collected, processed, consumed, and manipulated plants in the past, and how these different activities might have produced remains that we can collect, record, and analyze with archaeological methods.  The course will be a mixture of classroom discussion, lecture and presentation, outdoor field activities, and laboratory sessions.  Assignments will include independent field and laboratory data collection and experimentation that may include wild and/or domestic plant cultivation, harvest, processing, and storage; simulated combustion, decomposition, and other post-depositional modification of plant parts; and the post-recovery microscopy, dissection, and biogeochemical analysis of them.

What does it mean to belong, or not to belong? What does it mean to be mobile? What is a home, a homeland, home country, or nation? How do experiences of migration, exile, and displacement shift one’s understanding of home? Warfare, statecraft, and political violence, and recent environmental and social disasters, are giving rise to forms of belonging, mobility, and displacement that do not fit within traditional categories.  War and political violence destabilize national borders while reinforcing structures of power that bolster or mimic nation-state forms.  Environmental disaster and poverty cause displacements that cannot be classified purely in terms of either “economic” or “forced” migration, but produce composite categories which, as of yet, have no formal legal foothold, such as “economic” or “environmental” refugees. While popular culture often heralds the rise of multiculturalism in a globalized world, there are also alarming signals (surveillance, strategies of “profiling,” increasing militarization of borders, and race-related violence) that suggest that ideas of blood and territory continue as powerful delineators of inclusion and exclusion.  This course asks how belonging, mobility, and displacement take shape amid political violence; global migrations of people, capital, and ideas; social inequalities; new forms of political organization and governance (international, grass-roots, supranational); and the continued dominance of nation-states.

This course will investigate the racist paradigm, its organizing principles, and theoretical constructs. This course seeks to help the student understand the role of racism in the development of racial identities and also to ground the student in the basic tenets of the racist enterprise and its material realities.  The aim of this course is not to solve the problem of racism nor convince the student of the existence of racism. At the end of the course the student will have a basic understanding of the development of a racialized world.

The Roman Empire understood Christianity to be an illegal and superstitious movement, and a threat to the traditions of their ancestors.  Subsequently, many Christians were charged wit the crime of "atheism," and put to deant, as atheism was equivalent to treason.  Who were these people who voluntarily embraced their own deaths as a vindication of their faith, and how did Rome justify their extinction?  How were they understood by their pagan and Jewish neighbors?  We will explore the cultural, political and religious context of Christian martyrs (beginning in Second Temple Judaism).  We will then analyze their stories (martyrologies), imperial transcripts and legislation, and examine the later (Christian) Imperial legislatiory against "heretics."  This background in the ancient concepts of martyrdom will help us explore the evolution of such ideas through the Middle Ages and contemporary society.  The latter half of the course will focus on Islamic traditions of martyrdom, the political ramifications of such behavior, and reactions to the public spectacle of dying as the ultimate religious act.

What is the best way to accommodate religious and cultural diversity within a nation-state and in civil society? How should individual rights to practice religion be balanced with communal needs? Should freedom from religion be protected as much or more than freedom of religion? These are pressing contemporary issues in many countries, including the United States, but issues of religious diversity and questions of how—and even whether--to tolerate religious minorities have a long history. In this course, we will examine the toleration of minority religions in particular historical settings, and the issues and problems (both doctrinal and social/political) that societies grappled with as they confronted diverse religious landscapes.  We will also use these historical precedents as a lens to examine contemporary examples of religious pluralism, diversity, and conflict. Case studies will mainly be drawn from pre-modern Europe and modern Europe and North America, but we will also look at Mughal and modern India and discuss religion in pre-modern China.

Hayden, Milica

A Russian monk once observed that "each saint is a unique event." Indeed, in various religious traditions we encounter men and women who are recognized and venerated as particularly holy and unique witnesses to the divine. Just as each saint is unique within his or her tradition so is each tradition of saints unique in its articulation and expression of the overall religious culture. By looking cross-culturally at the materials on saints selected for this course and discussing (problematizing) the notion of sainthood itself, we examine religious themes, ideas and symbols found in them. These diverse writings are often marked by a very personal tone, a deeply felt relation with the divine (sometimes reflecting saint's inner struggles and/or their mystical experience of union), but also by pleas and calls for social and/or religious reforms. Our examples of devotional literature include Hindu, Muslim, and Christian sources, medieval as well as modern. Even though originating in specific religious contexts, many of these narratives raise issues which have wider human appeal and hence relevance for us today, too.

While the course considers the intersectional realities affecting masculinity and femininity on-screen, it will also consider who is behind the camera and ideas of “authentic” representation. Attention will also be paid to the social and historical context in which these films were made, in an attempt to understand the relationship between art and ideology.

How can we adequately represent the Vietnam War, one of the most complex, controversial, and traumatic events in American history?  For every story we tell, for every voice we hear, are there not many other stories forgotten and voices silenced?  This course approaches these questions through consideration of both cinematic and literary texts.  We will study these forms together not to prove one "better" than the other, but to enhance our understanding of the difficulties associated with representing an event that refuses to pass easily into "history."  The course is divided into two interrelated halves:  the first examines key films released during some of the most turbulent years of the Vietnam War (1964-1972) that tend to refer to the conflict through indirect means, while the second concentrates on films produced after the war that tend to address the conflict explicitly.  Again, the point is not to prove either "direct" or "indirect" representations of the war as somehow superior, but to analyze different strategies of representation and their relation to shifting historical contexts.  How does Vietnam literature depend on cinematic conventions?  How do Vietnam films draw on literary techniques?  How do these forms, alone and together, respond to the challenges of representing the Vietnam War?  Demanding, critically complex readings in film theory and film history will open up our consideration of such questions, and students will pose (and answer) questions of their own in weekly journal entries, rigorous critical essays, and intensive class discussion.

Ever since 1916 when German psychologist Hugo Munsterberg wrote The Photoplay: A Psychological Study in which he compared aspects of cinematic discourse to mental states (like attention, memory and anticipation), the film medium has frequently been conceived as analogous to the human mind.  Thus, numerous theorists, critics, and artists have probed the comparison in both written and cinematic form, while placing their formulations within a social, historical, and cultural framework (taking account of issues like race and gender).  Some (drawing upon psychoanalytic models) have likened cinema to the dream and many filmmakers (including Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali, Ingmar Bergman, Buster Keaton, David Lynch, etc.) have created oneiric works.  Other theorists have been interested in cinema’s potential to project human subjectivity through first person narrative, and movies as literal as The Lady in the Lake or as complex as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind have attempted to visualize such a viewpoint.  Some scholars have been intrigued by cinema’s capacity to embody memory or fantasy (as in Memento, Hiroshima Mon Amour or Juliet of the Spirits), while others have been concerned with film’s potential to mimic intellectual thought or human perception (as in the work of Hollis Frampton).  Furthermore, a group of theorists has recently examined audience reception to explore the dynamics of cognition and film--how screen information is “processed” by the viewer. And in a related move, another camp has focused on questions of affect and cinema --how particular spectator feelings or sensations are encouraged by or embodied in a film.  While the topics above deal with how film discourse can approximate mental activity or how a film can solicit certain mental states from the spectator, other resonant issues arise from the portrayal of what society sees as psychological “disorders” on screen—in both dramas and documentaries (e.g. madness, hysteria, nostalgia, locked-in syndrome, paranoia, hysteria, hallucination, etc.).  The class will seek to examine all of these areas through a series of screenings, readings, and discussions.

Majumdar,Neepa

The primary focus of this course will not be on cinematic representations of historical wars, but on theorizing the convergence of military and cinematic technologies, taking as one point of reference the significant body of writing produced by Paul Virilio, including his War and Cinema. Issues to be considered include the intersecting military, medical, and cinematic uses of the scope and the screen, theories of human vision and ocularcentrism, new conceptions of space and time, the temporal convergence of production and exhibition (speed), new media technologies, and the blurred boundaries of war and entertainment.  In this course and in your research papers, we will explore a visual field broadly conceived as constituted by military/medical and cinematic/entertainment technologies. Some of the technologies we might consider include radar, infra-red imaging, weather mapping, virtual reality, medical imaging, x-rays, reconnaissance/aerial photography, and drone images, looking specifically at films that substantially use such imaging or theorize these intersections.

Gupta, Anil

The logical and semantic paradoxes have had a decisive influence in shaping twentieth-century philosophy. They transformed--some would say, destroyed--Frege's logicism. They shaped Russell's philosophical outlook. And the argumentation found in them lies at the center of the proofs of the celebrated theorems of Gödel and Tarski. The paradoxes continue to be, in my view, a continuing source of logical insights. In this seminar we shall begin with a survey of the main contemporary approaches to the paradoxes--namely, Hierarchy, Fixed-Point, and Revision Theories. We shall then turn to an examination of some recent ideas. In particular, we shall study the recent work of Hartry Field.

This course is an introduction to Chinese philosophy. Roughly half of the course will be spent on classical Chinese Philosophy from Confucius through to Hanfeizi. The second half of the course will begin with Chinese Buddhism, discuss in detail the development of Song and Ming Dynasty Neo-Confucianism, continuing up to the Qing Dynasty philosophers Dai Zhen and Kang Youwei. The course will conclude with one session on Maoism. Students will acquire a basic knowledge of standard philosophical tools (how to reconstruct an argument from a text, how to assess the validity and soundness of an argument). They will also gain a working knowledge of the history of imperial China from the Warring States through to the Qing Dynasty in very broad outline, as seen through the lens of its greatest philosophical thinkers.

Charles Darwin’s ideas not only revolutionized biology - they also have revolutionary implications for how we see ourselves and our place in nature.  We will study the origins and development of Darwin’s ideas, and the reactions of the scientific, religious and philosophic community to them from Darwin’s time to our own.  The course revolves around two central questions: (1) What is the scientific status of Darwinism? (2) What are the implications of Darwinism for our beliefs about human nature?  We will spend the last few weeks of the term looking in detail at a variety of contemporary critics of Darwinism.

This course will explore topics in West European Intellectual History, 1850-1950. It will be conducted as a seminar centered upon student discussion. For this reason, students with be expected to read and engage the assigned sources before class. These sources will include readings in Mill, Durkheim, Mannheim, Freud and Existentialism. Some of our organizing questions will concern the nature of industrial and post-industrial society. We will ask about the possibility for social coherence in the modern world and we will explore the role of the intellectual. Student interests and concerns will determine other paths of enquiry. Course grades will be based on class participation and presentations, three papers, a midterm and a final.

This course is for students who have a desire to become familiar with the nature and motions of celestial objects in the night sky and techniques to observe them. Each week students meet for two 50 minute lectures on campus and one evening session at Allegheny Observatory. Transportation to the Allegheny Observatory is provided by the University. The course will be given at a level suitable for both science and non-science majors who want to learn how to use a telescope and enjoy observational and practical astronomy. The course will make use of existing Observatory facilities. The activities will focus on: (1) practical astronomy from the standpoint of understanding the motions of objects in the sky (including constellations versus celestial coordinate systems), (2) telescopes and their use, (3) observational astronomy using a digital CCD camera, (4) the nature of astronomical objects which are observable with the unaided eye or a small telescope.

In level 3 we strive to use a more developed grammar and vocabulary so we can talk about things beyond everyday life. Communicative skills continue to be our focus. Some topics that are covered are Swedish food and going to a restaurant, professions and work life, social etiquette and computers and internet. We continue expanding our grammar (for example reflexive verbs and the usage of past tense vs present perfect) and vocabulary by adding more authentic materials. At this level we read and discuss our first Swedish novel together, an abbreviated version of a popular current Swedish novel.

At level 5, we use mostly authentic materials as we get an in-depth knowledge of Swedish through the study of novels, current newspaper articles, literary excerpts, poems and movies. We move from finding and stating facts when using our Swedish into using persuasive language to be able to hold discussions about pets, social life, leisure time, habits and more. We introduce the conditional and past participles but only use grammar to improve our communicative skills.

Intonation refers to the melody of a language. Intuitively, we sense that Standard American English has different melodies from Spanish and British Received Pronunciation, that Mexican Spanish has different tunes from Northern Peninsular Spanish, and that all these languages sound very different from Mandarin Chinese. In this course, we will explore these differences in melody in a scientific manner by combining practical exercises with theory. In the first part of the course, we will focus on American English intonation. We will transcribe the intonation of American English and its different dialects with the ToBI system while eventually using Spanish as a point of comparison. We will combine this practical transcription component with theory on intonation systems by reading articles on topics such as the phonetic realization of pitch accents, pitch accent inventories across languages, and the relation of intonation with syntactic structure. In the second part of the course, we will expand our knowledge of English and Spanish intonation to other languages, especially non stress-accent languages, as well as more general topics. We will work on the intonation system of tonal languages like Chinese, of pitch-accent languages like Japanese and Basque, and of creoles like Palenquero. While exploring the intonation of non stress-accent languages, we will work on theory by reading on topics like intonation processing, the intonation of pathological speech, and L2 intonation.

Course description: This course deals with second language (L2) development from a variationist point of view.  Specifically, the course focuses on Type II (Rehner, 2002) or horizontal variation (Adamson & Regan, 1991), learner variation which also occurs naturally in native-speaker discourse.  Specific linguistic structures are studied both in terms of overall rates of use and the independent linguistic and social factors which condition such use. Both the influence of linguistic theory on variationist L2 research and the importance of L2 data for variation theory are discussed. Course readings consist of a core textbook (Geeslin with Long, 2014), in addition to empirical research articles on the acquisition of variation.  Combining L2 variationism with other relevant, functionalist L2 approaches will also be considered.  The course does not presuppose knowledge of second language acquisition, as the core text provides a base in covering the relevant conceptual information.

Data science is a fast-growing professional and academic discipline that is highly interdisciplinary in nature. Its practice centers on domain expertise: this course will introduce linguistics majors to core methods and practices in data science as it pertains to linguistic inquiry. Students will first learn the fundamentals of structuring, manipulating and sharing various forms of linguistic data; be given hands-on training on practical aspects of data processing, including handling large quantities of text data and creating statistical language models through machine learning; and get acquainted with the emerging field of knowledge engineering and ontology. Additionally, they will be given a chance to apply data-intensive methods to a term project of their choice.

This introductory course in biology is divided into two parts.  The first part covers the cellular basis of life including a discussion of simple chemistry; cells as units of structure and function; and energy transformations.  The second part includes an examination of those functions common to all organisms such as nutrition, gas and fluid transport, and hormonal and neuronal control.  Throughout, the emphasis is on the mechanisms used to accomplish these basic functions.  Student Level:  Not recommended for incoming students who place into MATH 0010.

The sequencing of the human genome has revolutionized the way in which we think about diverse biological topics.  This course will explore how advances in our understanding of such subjects have been made possible by innovative sequencing technologies.  This course will combine lecture, roundtable discussions and group presentations to explore how such technologies have allowed scientists to analyze genome-wide correlations between species to ultimately provide deeper insight into genome structure and function, the evolution of genomes, and the greater roles of genome analysis and editing in modern medicine.

This course explores the latest developments in contemporary art in the context of changes in world visual cultures since the 1960s. The first weeks will concentrate on the transformations of artistic practice that occurred initially in Pop Art, and on the Minimal-Conceptual shift in Western art. This will be followed by a survey of the diversification of artistic practice in the 1980s and 1990s, including the emergence of new internationalisms reflecting postcoloniality, global Contemporary Art, Indigenous art and digital media. The course will conclude with a consideration of the multiplicity of kinds of art that exist today. Visits to local museums and galleries are a vital part of the course.

This course, an advanced undergraduate seminar, is a counterpart to the introductory core course Introduction to World Art and invites students to think more critically about “World Art” as a disciplinary enterprise as it emerged in the last several decades with the ‘global turn’, post-colonialism, and a call for art history to be more inclusive.  Students will be introduced to key terms that are employed by this discourse (contact zones, planetarity, world-picturing, cosmopolitanism).  The course works through these ideas by focusing its attention on specific sites and art objects, case studies that explicitly circulate within or take as their subject the meeting point of different cultures and groups.

Jones,Shirin Asgharzadeh-Fozi and Ellenbogen,Joshua Martin

This seminar introduces students to contemporary theoretical methods in art history.  It does so by considering these methods in relation to the history of art and architecture department’s research constellations: Visual Knowledge, Agency, Identity, Mobility/Exchange, Contemporaneity, and Environment. While the course will always dedicate considerable attention to each one of the constellations, each year the course is taught it will privilege one or two of them.  By treating, over the course of a term, contemporary approaches in art history in relation to Visual Knowledge, or Identity, or Environment, the course aims not only to provide a broad survey of what it means to do art history in the early twenty first century, but to forge novel connections between the panoply of intellectual approaches available to scholars now.  At the same time, while not a primarily historiographical course, the class also aims to shed light on trajectories in the art historical discipline’s intellectual development. The format of the class will center on discussion and close readings of both material objects and art historical texts, and the careful consideration of what it means to apply a given theoretical approach to problems in the visual arts. The course is open to graduate students in art history and to students from other disciplines with a strong interest in the visual arts.

This course emphasizes articles and analyses of selected issues in health, illness, and medical care. One set of issues concerns health and illness as dominant metaphors in contemporary American society and the relation of these metaphors to broader trends involving what some writers describe as "the medicalization of life" and others describe as the "medicalization of deviance." In this context we will examine the ways in which medicine has displaced both religion and the laws as the dominant form of social control in the late 20th century. It also means examining and critically analyzing the way in which recent developments in medical technology, health care policy, and the organization of health care services are transforming our basic notions of health, illness, and medical care.

This course will sample idiosyncratically from the post-classical theoretical tradition. The primary vectors of inquiry will include: “neo-” theories in class analysis (Marxist, Weberian, Durkheimian), the Frankfurt school, social constructionism, practice theory, and theories of culture and representation. In line with the substantive focus of the sociology department, we will also attend closely to issues of social inequality, especially class, race, gender, and sexuality as principles of social organization of identities and institutions.

Hughes, Melanie

This course examines central topics in the study of gender and politics, covering such issues as women’s participation in political parties and social movements, the roads women take to local and national political office, feminism and the state, and gender and international politics. The course is global in its focus and considers women’s acquisition of political power in countries around the world. But, students will also be introduced to research on women in politics in American society. Whenever possible, we will be attentive to the ways in which gender intersects with other social identities, such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation.

What is the best way to accommodate religious and cultural diversity within a nation-state and in civil society? How should individual rights to practice religion be balanced with communal needs? Should freedom from religion be protected as much or more than freedom of religion? These are pressing contemporary issues in many countries, including the United States, but issues of religious diversity and questions of how—and even whether--to tolerate religious minorities have a long history. In this course, we will examine the toleration of minority religions in particular historical settings, and the issues and problems (both doctrinal and social/political) that societies grappled with as they confronted diverse religious landscapes.  We will also use these historical precedents as a lens to examine contemporary examples of religious pluralism, diversity, and conflict. Case studies will mainly be drawn from pre-modern Europe and modern Europe and North America, but we will also look at Mughal and modern India and discuss religion in pre-modern China.

Throughout, our goal will be to consider race both as a source of identity and social differentiation as well as a system of privilege, power and inequality affecting everyone in the society albeit in different ways.

This course examines the historical origins of important changes taking place in Latin America today. Those changes include: the election of female presidents in several countries of the region; the rise of racially defined black (Afro-descendent) and indigenous (Amerindian) political movements; current environmental challenges and responses. Through readings, films, discussion and writing exercises, we will try to set those current events in their historical context and to think seriously about their implications for the future.

Central questions we will address include: when, how, and why did the North American economy become capitalist, and what did that actually mean in the lives of ordinary people; what role did the conquest of Native American land play in the development of a specifically American form of capitalism; what was the historical relationship between slavery and capitalism in North America, and throughout the Atlantic world more broadly; and how did gender, race, and class interact, and what role did each play, in the early history of American capitalism?

Yet it is also associated with the rapid industrialization of the USSR, the end of unemployment at a time of world depression, the collectivization of agriculture, upward social mobility for millions of Russians, the defeat of Nazi Germany in WWII, and the rise of the USSR to world power status. This course will examine the Soviet Union during Stalin’s rule as well as his rise to and consolidation of power.

Putnam,Lara Elizabeth

This course ranges widely over the past two hundred years of Latin American history to explore the lives of women in all their complexity and diversity, from nineteenth-century enslaved wet nurses to indigenous marketwomen to modern ballet stars.  Women’s lives in Latin America have embodied a series of contradictions that make us rethink U.S.-based assumptions about gender, sexuality, and power.  This is a region where traditional gender roles coexist with a spectrum of sexual identities; where devout Catholicism and motherhood have at times fueled radical political action by women. We will draw on films, documentaries, and autobiographies as well as the writings of historians and anthropologists. Our goal will be to map the range and complexity of Latin American women’s lives and track how they have changed over time.

This course will survey approximately 250 years of American history, from the fateful first attempts to establish a permanent European presence in the late fifteenth century Caribbean to the early rumblings of North American independence in the mid-seventeen-hundreds. While the focus will most often return to those geographic regions that eventually would be claimed by the United States, our perspective throughout will be much broader. Most importantly, we will place the history of colonial North America in both Atlantic and continental contexts, seeking to understand how its development was critically shaped through the complex interactions of many different peoples, Native American, European, and African.

What are the political meaning of Donald Duck, the Lone Ranger, or the Rolling Stones? How do seemingly non-political culture industries shape cultural, political, and economic behavior? Must the processes of cultural production, distribution, and consumption function to promote the interests of the corporate capitalists who organize and control the processes, or does the cultural arena offer spaces where political and cultural alternatives can contest for influence? Can a complex industrial civilization organize cultural production in other ways than market-driven corporate mass production? We will address these questions by looking at and writing about a series of cases studies in US cultural history of the 1930s and 1960s.

Environmental History is an established way of studying how the relationships between humans and the rest of nature have changed over time. This course looks at Russian and Soviet Empire from the perspective of environment and its spaces. We will trace the history of this part of Eurasia from the nineteenth century to the recent past, examining how relationships between humans and the natural world affected or reflected changing societies. We will address how approaches of Environmental Studies can illuminate dimensions of empire, such as politics, society, economy, and culture. We will explore various topics in the history of Russian and formerly Soviet lands, including exploration and imperialism under the tsars, Stalinist industrialization, and economic growth, environmentalism, and climate change under socialism. We will also seek to identify continuities and discontinuities between socialist and post-socialist human relationships with the natural world. For example, we will study the legacy of the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, Ukraine. Students will leave the course better at leveraging history to understand the environmental stakes associated with contemporary life.

This course will examine historical patterns of race relations in the U.S., Latin America (Brazil, Cuba), Africa (South Africa), and Asia (India). For India, the focus will be more on caste relations, particularly untouchability, as a counterpoint to caste-like race relations in the U. S. and South Africa. The course will include pictures, videos and other materials acquired on trips to those locations in 1993, 1997 and 2002. The overall goal of the course will be comparative: to examine the operation of these processes in a variety of economic, political and cultural settings.

The 'City as Text' seminar focuses on analyzing cities as readable realities that can be interpreted, so as to enable students to appreciate the ways in which cities (the built environment) can be understood as physical and symbolic manifestations of those forces (be they ideological, cultural, political, economic, social or technological) that shaped them and were, in turn, shaped by those forces.  Following a series of readings on methodological and conceptual issues, the seminar focuses on case studies from various geographical areas and time periods, although the major focus is on 19th and 20th century cities.

This course aims to provide a strong foundation in the principles of modern structural equation modeling (SEM), with an emphasis on the applied use of these techniques.  The goal is to provide students with a strong set of fundamentals that will allow them to flexibly apply SEM to sophisticatedly answer diverse questions in a wide variety of data.  Core topics covered will include conceptual introduction to latent variable models, fundamentals of covariance structure models (e.g., data requirements, identification, etc.), measurement models and confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, full SEM, multiple group analysis, measurement invariance, and the basics of longitudinal models (e.g., cross-lagged panel designs, growth curve models).  Introductions to advanced topics will be offered time permitting (e.g., SEM with categorical data, advanced growth curve modeling, mediation with bootstrapped errors, exploratory structure equation modeling).  Examples will draw from the behavioral sciences, mostly psychology.  Student evaluation will be based on take-home exercises, quizzes, and a final project.  Students are encouraged to work with their advisors to identify suitable data for analysis in their final projects, with a goal of producing a publication ready product at the end of the term.  The primary statistical package used in this course will likely be Mplus.

This seminar seeks to provide students with an overview of the emerging field of affective neuroscience. The course will focus on the current research on the brain basis of fear learning and memory, emotion regulation, reward, and common forms of psychopathology such as depression and anxiety. These topics will be discussed on molecular and cellular levels, as well as from a systems-neuroscience vantage point. Class meetings will involve presentations by students, as well as discussions of empirical and review articles in both human and non-human animal samples. Goals of the course include: (1) gaining knowledge of seminal theories of emotion, (2) identifying related neural circuits, (3) critiquing and conducting affective neuroscience research, and (4) connecting these insights to other research disciplines (cognitive, social, and developmental).

From plantation slavery to the neoliberal present, the Caribbean has been the site of an accelerated modernity––but it is often not recognized as such.  Instead, for many Americans, the Caribbean conjures images of the primitive or exotic; anachronistic underdevelopment or backward belief; banana republics and backyards that entitle the US to attempt control of oil, water, trade, and ideology; extremist Islam and anti-American revolutions; military confrontations and military bases; threatening overpopulation, poverty, debt, failed states, drug cartels, natural and ecological disasters, high unemployment, and mass out-migrations.

Materialities Of Writing

Vee, Annette

What difference does it make whether we write with pencils, stone tablets, quills, parchment, hyperlinks, computer code, scrolls or codices? Do our thinking or our society change with the styluses and surfaces we use to record it? How much of modern bureaucracy can be chalked up to the permanence and flexibility of paper and the organizational innovations of filing systems? How do computer databases enable government surveillance as well as sophisticated literary narratives? First explored by scholars such as Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan, questions about the materialities of writing have again become central to research on electronic texts, the history of the book, and the ways that software and objects accompany our compositional practices. In this seminar, we will focus on writing and materiality, paying attention to historical technologies as well as contemporary, computational contexts of writing. We will move, roughly, from scenes of writing to surfaces, symbols, sendings, storage, and social situations of writing, avoiding following a linear historical trajectory in order to focus on larger themes of materiality. Authors will include Drucker, Hayles, Barthes, Flusser, Shipka, Kirschenbaum, Gitelman, McLuhan, T. Gillespie, A. Banks. To draw attention to the materialities of writing, assignments — signments — will ask you to compose not necessarily in traditional, written academic genres but in text, code, online spaces and physical objects. The course blog will be a shared space for weekly writing about these signments and readings. The final project for the course will be an extension of your choice of one of these smaller signments.

This class will explore the relations between minds and machines, investigating some of the philosophical issues raised by artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the scientific disciplines that since the 1950s have sought to understand the nature of mind through comparisons with human-created information processing devices. The course will focus on approaches to naturalizing intentionality (and the nature of intentional actions) and the problem(s) of consciousness. With respect to the latter, we will discuss the recent resurgence of interest in the scientific study of consciousness.

Mind and Medicine deals with problems and questions that arise in considering how the mind plays certain roles in medical theory and practice.  Of course, this means we must think about what the mind is. We will begin this course by looking at nature of emotions (particularly pleasure, fear, and empathy), how they might be explained, and see what role emotions play in judgments.  Then we shall move on to examine briefly the placebo effect, what it is, and how it might function.  From there we shall examine a case of a common mental illness, depression, and use it to examine the nature of explanation in medicine generally. We shall contrast such explanations with those given in evolutionary psychology. Finally, we will examine the some of the interrelations among certain aspects of mind, brain, and body.

This course will examine selected historically important theories and portrayals of the human emotions or passions.  The course will examine different accounts of love, hate, desire, anger, jealousy, pride, grief, etc., ie. the affective dimension of human existence.  It will look at how these dimensions of experience relate to ideas of reason, control, the will, decorum, and morality, and our knowledge of the "sciences" of human beings. A number of questions will guide the readings and discussions.  Which emotions or passions are primitive?  In what are the emotions grounded: the body, the mind, the spirit?  Can these even be usefully distinguished? What is the structure of human emotions and how do they function?  What are the relations among emotions, personality types and behavior?  Can one learn to recognize emotions, control emotions, change the way emotions affect behavior?  How can one test or validate theories about emotions? And finally, it is clear that theories and beliefs about human emotions change over time; does this mean that the nature of, say, anger, has changed over time? The course will rely mostly on primary source material, written by persons who have had a recognized intellectual and social impact.

18th Century Theatre

Hogg,Chloe Alice

Rousseau famously condemned French theater as nothing but talk; Saint-Preux, in Rousseau’s novel Julie ou la Nouvelle Héloïse, dismisses Racine and Corneille as “only talkers.” In this way, Rousseau anticipates the 20th-century reception of early modern theater as a theater of words—classical French theater is about language, discourse; it is without materiality; its ideal, in the words of Racine, is “a play about nothing.” So Racine’s theater has passions, but no bodies; and Corneille’s theater (sorry, Corneille) is eclipsed by Racine’s: transparent, empty, the “zero degree” of French classicism. But what do we do with this notion of early modern French theater in the wake of the affective and the material turns, or the history of emotions or the senses?

Questions of gender and sexuality were central to the development of the French Renaissance in the sixteenth century. “La querelle des femmes”—the debate over the nature and status of women—became a major focus in literary and cultural texts of the period, both for men and for women who argued at length about whether men and women were “equal.” While women could not be queens in France because of a curious institution called “Salic Law,” female regents nonetheless asserted political power in the kingdom. Because the development of Renaissance Humanism had major implications for constructs of masculinity and femininity, the seminal question Joan Kelly asked in the 70’s “Did Women have a Renaissance?” can still be asked, though perhaps in different terms. The study of the ancients, while at the basis of the Renaissance, provoked great anxiety as writers and thinkers reworked the less attractive aspects of Greek and Latin texts in a Christian world. Non-normative or queer morphologies of gender and sexuality also became popular in literary, visual, and cultural texts as hermaphrodites and other monsters appeared with surprising frequency. Stories of sex change circulated in literary and medical texts of the period, and male poets wrote “lesbian” poems. Ancient and Italian texts afforded new definitions of masculine and feminine identity, as well as love and desire, in a post-medieval world defined by fragmentation and fluidity. In this seminar, we will examine and interrogate key cultural constructs of gender and sexuality conveyed in texts of early modern France. This central issue will lead us to consider many of the main cultural and literary currents of the period—such as Humanism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, marriage, medicine, friendship, kingship, politics—and thus provide students with little or no background in Renaissance studies an understanding of the century’s context. We will read both canonical and non-canonical writers (Rabelais, Montaigne, Labé, Paré, Artus), but we will also use various cultural discourses to organize our thinking (e.g. the body in medical texts, masculinity in tracts on friendship, regents in satirical texts). At the same time, we will examine relations between the early modern period and select recent approaches in gender studies—including theoretical issues around masculinity, the sex/gender distinction, gender fluidity, transgenderism, the body, and same-sex sexualities. The course thus aims to give students the opportunity to think about how to go about studying questions of gender and sexuality when such questions are at the fore in the Humanities, and it aims to help students think about how to contextualize theoretical questions around gender within a specific socio-historical context. Course taught in French.

Our primary text will be Dark Ghettos: Injustice, Dissent, and Reform, by Tommie Shelby (Pitt PhD), with reference to related work (especially by Elizabeth Anderson) in “non-ideal” political theory.   Though we’ll focus primarily on philosophical issues – such as the values on which policy discussions tend tacitly to rest and the tendency of those who make policy to pathologize and/or moralize behaviors that should perhaps be viewed as legitimate forms of dissent on the part of those who suffer systemic injustice – we’ll also draw (as Shelby and Anderson draw) on the work of a wide range of thinkers from e.g., law, economics, sociology and cultural theory.   Our aim will be to get through Shelby’s book by late October, when visitors from these fields will participate together with Shelby in a Humanities Center conference on his book, and then to spend the remainder of the term discussing drafts of one another’s final papers.  This is research seminar.

This course will introduce and investigate dynamic semantics. Very roughly, this is an approach to semantics on which meanings are identified with incremental changes to a body of information. This is meant to contrast with, or perhaps generalize, `static’ approaches on which meanings are supplied by referents, concepts, or truth-conditions. A special focus of the course will be on foundational questions about dynamic theories. What makes a theory dynamic, and not static? What kind of evidence could there be for a distinctively dynamic (or static) theory? Though these foundational questions will be our focus, we will keep them grounded through a number of case studies, likely drawn from anaphora, generalized quantification, presupposition, and epistemic modality.

This course offers a broad cultural and historical survey of rhetorical handbooks from the ancient, late antique, medieval, and early modern periods. It will be useful to students from a variety of fields interested in the intellectual and institutional histories of rhetoric. We will begin with selections from the Sophists, from Plato, Isocrates, Antisthenes, and Aristotle, as well as from Cicero, Seneca, Quintilian, and Tacitus, with particular focus on the formation and development of a rhetorical discipline, the changing contexts for rhetorical performance, and the tension between rhetoric and philosophy. We will then consider late antique pagan rhetoricians (Themistius, Libanius) and Church Fathers (Tertullian, Augustine), with emphasis on the religious dimensions of their early Christian rhetorics and its potential as a tool for interpreting scripture. We will move on to medieval materials (Boethius, Cassiodorus, Isidore of Seville, Bede, Hugh of St. Victor, Aquinas, Petrarch, and Bracciolini), focusing on the enduring influence of the Ciceronian tradition, the place of rhetoric in monastic communities and church education, the Islamic readers of Aristotle’s Rhetoric, and its eventual rediscovery and reception in the Latin (and vernacular) West. We conclude with certain renaissance and early modern rhetorics (Erasmus, Philipp Melanchthon, Peter Ramus), with special attention given to the centrality of rhetoric to investigations of the passions, to early aesthetics, and to the development of civil philosophies (politics, psychology, law, literature). Throughout the term, we will also read and discuss modern treatments of rhetorical theory and of the “deep” history of rhetoric, and survey the major debates in the field. All readings will be accessible in English.

Tradurre, tradire. So goes the old Italian saying: to translate is always a betrayal. What makes translation such a complicated and risky process? What, exactly, is the “betrayal” against? What does this kind of formulation tell us about how society views source texts (or “originals”) and their translation into other languages, formats, and medias? This course examines translation from both a theoretical and practical perspective, allowing students to understand the ways in which translation has been formulated, promoted, and criticized, but also giving them a laboratory for the translation of texts of various kinds and genres, including letters, oral histories, publicity materials, literature, and even film subtitles. Students in this class will move from short translation exercises to longer translation projects, culminating in a multi-piece portfolio of their translation projects, which will draw on untranslated materials from local archives and library collections. Course languages: Italian and English, as appropriate. Prerequisite: ITAL 0060, 0061, or 1041.

This graduate seminar aims to trace the history of translation theory while offering students the opportunity to engage both in critical translation analysis and practically-oriented translation production of their own. Students in this seminar will, over the course of the semester, develop a thorough and contextualized understanding of how translation practices are embedded in value-laden social and literary systems, and how those systems impact everything from publishing decisions to copyright law, from the translator’s “invisibility” to theories of “world” literature. Students will apply these considerations to their analyses of published translations, as well as to original translations of unpublished material, which will be regularly workshopped and assembled into a final portfolio. Course languages: Italian and English, as appropriate. Prerequisite: graduate status.

Theatre history demands to be studied in a holistic way. This is particularly true in the case of Italian theatre, where from the days of Commedia dell'Arte, the actor rather than the playwright has been often the central figure. As we study the plays of world renowned Italian playwrights of the present and last century (such as Luigi Pirandello, Eduardo De Filippo, Dario Fo and Franca Rame) and their performance history, we will take into consideration the lasting influence that this actor-author tradition firmly established by the Commedia dell’Arte had/ has on their notions of and approaches to drama. This course is taught entirely in Italian and satisfies the General Education 2nd Literature/Art Requirement. Prerequisite: Italian 0060, 0061 or 1041.

Apparatus Theory now, more than ever! Once the heart of Anglo-American Screen Theory, Apparatus Theory generated lively debates about the relation of the moving image and the mechanisms of production that brought it to the screen.  Having run into certain impasses regarding gender and ideology, AT became quiescent in the English-speaking world. Outside, however, it continued to develop in new dynamic directions. This seminar will review the multifaceted history of AT and deploy it in analyses of a series of international moving images from mainstream to experimental. The course will be in English. Films will have English subtitles. Public screenings will take place separately outside seminar meetings. Students are asked to sign up for the lab at that time.

This is an elementary language course for students who have not previously studied any German. In this proficiency-oriented course students begin to learn how to communicate in German. This course meets three hours per week, and students are expected to study regularly on their own to keep up with the material. The course emphasizes all four skills—speaking, listening, reading, and writing – and introduces students to the culture of the German-speaking countries. By the end of the first semester, successful students should be able to take the A1-Exam of the Goethe Institut, which follows the Common European Framework of Reference and is accepted worldwide. Students should plan to take German 0002 or 0102 during the following semester.

In this course, students study the socio-political and cultural structures which shape the self-understanding of Austria, Germany and Switzerland today by exploring key issues and challenge these countries are facing today. Topics may include: political and social structures, the educational system and youth culture, gender and sexuality, Euroscepticism, im/migration and the rise of populist movements, the shadow of the Holocaust, and the status of cultural institutions in these societies. Students thus work with current, authentic materials ranging from the printed press to social media, from literature to film. The teaching objectives can be summarized in three equally important categories: a) To gain knowledge of the German-speaking world today; b) To develop tools for analyzing another culture; c) To hone German language skills in all four areas: listening and reading comprehension, speaking and writing. This course is taught entirely in German. Hence, it facilitates the development of a contemporary German vocabulary and includes the practice of advanced grammar structures as necessary.

Slovak European history and the interaction of Slovak and American cultures during the 120-year history of Slovak immigration is conveyed through readings in Slovak and Slovak-American literature, and through issues in literary theory that concern this theme. The syllabus follows the changes in Slovak culture and society over time, with a special emphasis on the changes brought about by the interaction of Slovak and American cultures. The content of the readings in literature follows the temporal sequence, while the actual sources for each period are grouped to illustrate a variety of literary genres. The course is structured around the history of Slovak, and in a broader cultural sense Central European, immigration to the United States with a special focus on Pittsburgh. It is examined within the context of the developments in Slovak culture and history with an emphasis on literature. The students are encouraged to investigate Pittsburgh’s rich ethnic heritage and to research and write on topics tailored to their individual interests.

This course explores the evolution of Korean literature in the modern era. In this course, students will examine major writers from the early twentieth century to the present. In reading their works, students will be guided to identify key thematic and formal issues in modern Korean literature and to situate them within a larger historical and cultural context. Topics to be discussed include colonial legacies, the Korean War, national division (and the Cold War paradigm), authoritarian rule, democracy movements, nationalism, developmentalism, class struggles, gendered modernization, and globalization. This course, however, does not regard literary texts simply as a reflection of historical conditions; its main concern instead rests with understanding the distinctive perspectives and styles Korean writers have fostered in confrontation of historical changes. In doing so, students will gain not only basic knowledge of literary traditions in Korea, but also the skills for critical engagement in debates on Korean society and culture.

Critical Making
3 cr.
	
TuTh / 04:00 PM-05:15 PM / 00206CL
Horton, Zachary K

The Maker movement is an emerging social and media form that is at once highly networked and post-digital. Making is situated at the intersection of social media, the online gift economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with one's physical environment. Drawing on open source ideals and innovation structures—the free sharing of code to enable collaborative development—making has become an attempt to democratize material culture through networked access to tools. MakerSpaces and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materialize the virtual gift economy of the Internet. In this course we will engage the intellectual and practical roots of this new medial and social form and engage in our own critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will begin by looking at the history and philosophy of open source software development, and then the political, social, cultural, and technological developments that have together given rise to critical maker culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning, modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printing assignments, students will form groups and develop collaborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a topic of your choice. The aim of this course is to “close the circuit” between creative conceptual production, social networking, and materialized object relationships. Critical making is about critically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. No prior “making” experience is needed. By the end of the semester, you will become a critical maker in the medium of your choice!

This course focuses on multiple “things” academics and scholars “do with literature.” Some of these things are parts of the work of writing an academic literary critical article (or book)—the things that are often taken for granted or are otherwise often downplayed in some courses. Some of these things do not necessarily lead to literary critical essays. Students will learn how to move from an initial reading of a piece of literature to an idea for a longer critical paper. Students will learn how to do primary research and build their own understanding of a particular moment in literary history. Students will learn to read and work with literary theory as well as to discover the way fictional invention can be driven by critical interventions in culturally dominant assumptions and values. By the end, students will know how to do many things with literature and finish the semester with a strong portfolio of scholarly work.

One of the unexpected byproducts of the proliferation of new media platforms is a renewed appreciation of the book as a richly complex medium for literary expression. A book is never simply a neutral container of literary content: it both constrains and enables literary practices. This course will seek to develop an understanding of the book as a complicated material object, the product of specialized divisions of labor and diverse publishing practices of making, formatting, distributing, and selling physical copies of texts. There will be several hands-on exercises in making—and unmaking—books as well as directed research in Hillman Library’s Special Collections on the history of book production. We will investigate the relationship between the format of a book and various literary forms: how, for instance, does publication of a novel in serial numbers influence its style? And we will explore literary texts that play seriously with the book, including poetry by Blake and Dickinson, contemporary artist’s books, Danielewski’s House of Leaves, and some born-digital texts.

This course introduces students to themes and forms of what has come to be known as contemporary Asian American literature. We will question the possibility of such a canon given the diversity of poetry, novels, and short stories by Chinese American, Japanese American, Korean American, Vietnamese American, and Indian American authors. These works challenge U.S. ideologies such as the melting pot and the American dream as they dramatize Asian American exclusion, incarceration, labor exploitation, invasion and diaspora. Coming-of-age stories reveal how familial strife between first and second generations mirrors protagonists’ internalized transnational conflicts as they feel torn between competing cultures: living in the west in body and east in mind. Close readings also illuminate Asian American characters’ struggles with identity formation due to the dissonance of their assigned gender, sexuality, class, or religion.

The Western in film, fiction, and television tells the central epic story of the conquest, settlement, and transformation of America.  It's full of adventure, opportunity, violence, shame and glory.  But not only cowboys and Indians, gold miners and outlaws peopled this story.  Its characters went West, and still do, for many reasons—foremost, for freedom.  They could escape the urban life, alienating jobs, social restrictions, health problems, sometimes the Law or a regrettable past.  They remade themselves.  The vast frontier with its rugged landscapes, wild animals, often resistant indigenous people, and daunting weather invited adventurers and tested their courage and resources.

Reading World Literature as Translation.  (No knowledge of a foreign language is required).  This course introduces students to the study of world literature as translated texts.We examine different English versions of literary texts (including the new Google Translator version) and also films dealing with translation: Villeneuve's Arrival (2017) and Coppola’s Lost in Translation (2003).  You will learn about how gender shapes the rendering of texts into English, including controversial versions of sexuality and of the US:  Kafka’s Amerika, Beauvoir’s America Day by Day and The Second Sex, as well as Anzaldua’s Borderlands and Char's and Vallejo's poems. We read theories of translation from Spain, Mexico, Argentina, Russia, Africa, the US, and other cultures.  You can choose your own world lit./film topic or write your own short story on translation for a major assignment.  The course satisfies GEC Writing (pending approval), 2nd Lit/Arts/Creative Expression; Engl.

In this course, we will consider how early English texts represent, challenge and re-imagine the social world.   Medieval Europe was a cultural cross-roads, sometimes peaceably borrowing, sometimes forced to adapt ideas, forms, religious and social practices not only from near neighbors but also from the older cultures of the Mediterranean.   Such cultural volatility is evident not only in religious writings, but also in romance and works of social critique (both comic and visionary). We will read across a range of genres, including medieval lyrics, mystical writings and selections from The Canterbury Tales and  Piers Plowman.

We will also discuss such topics as cross-gender disguise and the intersections of gender with race and class.  We will consider Shakespeare's plays together with controversial works by other Renaissance writers, female and male, as well as with some recent attempts to rewrite the roles, plots, and cultural judgments about Shakespeare's women in new literature.

We will investigate a number of interrelated topics:  the rise of women writers and readers; the self-conscious construction of a national literature and its relationship to empire; the emergence of new genres, publication practices, and forms or occasions of instruction in the uses of reading; and various social, cultural and literary "revolutions" that opposed or extended quests for "enlightenment."  We will read a range of diverse texts written in England, Ireland, and the American colonies during the long eighteenth century.  As we read and discuss these texts, we will reflect on the values and problems of literary culture and on the possible contemporary uses of literary historical study.

This course is designed to develop your skills as a nonfiction writer. Through a combination of required readings, creative exercises, peer critiques and critical discussions, you will develop an understanding of the fundamentals of journalism as well as an introduction to the wide-ranging possibilities of nonfiction writing as a genre: narrative long form, the personal essay, immersion journalism and forms of creative nonfiction. This class will be divided into two components; gathering information and shaping stories.

This writing course considers ways in which creative writing with a conscience can tell a story while also commenting upon social and political issues of our day. At times a writer makes such commentary explicit; in other moments, engaging storytelling enables more implicit advocacy. Through writing assignments, discussions, field work, and readings in nonfiction, as well as some fiction and poetry, students will consider strategies of craft and explore modes of being a political and social writer and artist. Students will work toward a final writing project of their choosing.

Studio in African American Poetry and Poetics is a course in interdisciplinary making, as we investigate the evolving fields of African American poetry and poetics through a critical and a creative lens. In this class, we will think and work across genres (poetry, prose), mediums (page, canvas, digital, film, or theatrical space), and disciplines (writing, literary criticism, visual arts, drama choreography, history, etc.), and collapse the walls between presenter and audience, creator and critic, as we work individually and collaboratively toward new modes of making. Intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, this course will also provide students with hands-on opportunities to work on events, archival projects, and community outreach, and consider these activities from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Companies want your attention. You are a consumer of products and  services. You represent a prospective employee. You could become a  shareholder. So companies reach out to you through advertising, annual reports, blogs, brochures, newsletters, podcasts, promotions, and  websites, among other means. And as companies are seeking your attention, they can't ignore other audiences--current employees, investors, government officials, and the media, for example--who are  critical to their success. Companies have plenty to talk about--their brand, vision, values, new products or services, job openings,  employment benefits, financial results, social responsibility efforts-- depending on who is listening. In this class, you will examine how companies create their identity through language. You will actively explore five "languages": employment, marketing, culture, results, and social responsibility. You will study good business writing and apply these techniques in several writing assignments. For example, you will produce a report analyzing the employment brand of two companies where you would like to work after graduation. In a different assignment focused on corporate social responsibility, you will create original communications for a selected company.

The topic of this class is Writing for the Web. We will explore the whole range of professional writing for online contexts (including social networking and Web 2.0 applications). Students will learn about the ways that technology, audience needs and expectations, and the larger culture all drive online writing. The class will alternate lecture/discussion sessions with studio sessions, so that students can workshop their webpages and online writing. Students will create an online portfolio for themselves, design and then write content for at least one other website, and explore social networking via LinkedIn, Twitter, Delicious, and more. Students can expect to learn about creating online personas for individuals and organizations. They will also learn how to critically analyze audiences, explore platform constraints, match messages to delivery methods, and use Web 2.0 applications to collaborate on writing projects. This advanced course is intended for students who are pursuing the PPW Certificate, as well as other students interested in careers in writing, editing, or publishing.  Students will work through software tutorials in Dreamweaver outside of class (using Lynda.com). While the campus computer labs do offer Dreamweaver, you may want to purchase the Adobe Creative Suite so that you can work on web pages at home. The Software Licensing Center in Bellefield Hall offers students the Adobe Web Premium Creative Suite package for around $200 (a savings of about $500).  This class assumes that students are comfortable with using a computer and with learning new software. It is helpful if students have already satisfactorily completed Engcmp 400, 410, or 420 or equivalent.

History Of Particle Physics
3 cr.
	
Tu / 09:30 AM-11:15 AM / 00G28CL
Williams, Porter D.

Beginning with the discovery of the electron in 1897, the development of particle physics is a story of theoretical, technological, social, and epistemological transformations. It is a history of transformative theoretical developments in our understanding of spacetime and matter: the discovery of special relativity and quantum mechanics, their unification in quantum field theory, and the birth of the Standard Model of particle physics. It is also a history of tremendous technological innovation, beginning with Thompson's comparatively humble cathode ray experiments in the late 19th century to the staggering complexity of the Large Hadron Collider. These technological innovations have been intertwined with social factors in science and society more broadly: Not only has the increasing complexity of the experimental apparatus given rise to experimental collaborations of unprecedented scale, the increasing cost of these experiments has necessitated greater interaction between particle physics' collaborations and governmental funding agencies. Finally, both the production of scientific knowledge in large collaborations and the increasing importance of computer simulation present complex epistemological challenges. Required knowledge of physics will be kept to a minimum, and all of the necessary physics will be introduced in class.

Glass,Michael Roy

Social justice and economic justice are popular buzz-words that are closely tied to urban environments: but what do they really mean, and how can we understand them? URBNST 1612 uses critical social geography to interrogate both historical and contemporary social justice movements that claim to protect human rights, fair housing, or to expand definitions of public space and citizenship.  Taken together these agendas form a powerful prescription for social action – one often emerging in urban settings.  Using a combination of lectures, Concept Mapping exercises, and case studies, we will examine the historical and theoretical context for social justice in the city and then evaluate different geographies of social change.  By the end of the course students will be able to use a critical perspective to understand how the rhetoric of social justice is changing the urban geographies of specific cities worldwide.

This advanced seminar on human growth and development will address basic theories and principles of organismic growth using a life cycle approach from conception through death. It will also discuss evolutionary changes in human growth patterns and assess environmental and genetic influences on normal and pathological growth patterns of extant human populations. After this course the student should come to appreciate that: 1)  normal human growth patterns are a result of an interaction of nature (biology and genetics) and nurture (physical and cultural environment); 2) abnormal growth patterns related to disease or pathological states are a result of genetic or environmental perturbations in normal patterns which produce recognizable dystrophic or dysplastic morphologies; and 3) that even with such perturbations, the human growth pattern is still very resilient and succeeds in maintaining the characteristic human morphology.

This course will explore topics in West European Intellectual History, 1850-1950.  It will be conducted as a seminar driven by student discussion.  For this reason, students with be expected to read and engage the assigned sources before class.  These sources will include readings in Mill, Durkheim, Mannheim, Freud and Existentialism as well as sources in visual, literary and other art forms.  Some of our organizing questions will concern the nature of industrial and post-industrial society.  We will ask about the nature of social coherence and civil society, and whether their structures are developing or devolving in the modern world.  We will ask what these developments mean for the state of our political and economic systems.  Student interests and concerns will determine multiple other paths of enquiry as well.  Course grades will be based on class participation and presentations, quizzes, papers, a midterm and a final.

Studies In Aristotle
3 cr.

Lennox, James G.

Recently philosophers engaged in inquiry in ethics, metaphysics, and philosophy of science have been explicit in acknowledging inspiration from Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition, often identifying their projects as “Neo-Aristotelian”.  In this seminar we will do a selective examination of work in this genre, focused not only on the merits and shortcomings of that work itself, but also on its connections with Aristotle’s philosophical inquiries into the same or related topics. It is hoped that a clear (or clearer) answer will emerge to the question, “What is it to be an Aristotelian (or “Neo-Aristotelian”) in the 21st century?”.

 This course examines central topics in the study of gender and politics, covering such issues as women’s participation in political parties and social movements, the roads women take to local and national political office, feminism and the state, and gender and international politics. The course is global in its focus and considers women’s acquisition of political power in countries around the world. But, students will also be introduced to research on women in politics in American society. Whenever possible, we will be attentive to the ways in which gender intersects with other social identities, such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation.

Philosophy of climate science is a topic of growing importance in the philosophical literature. This seminar deals with issues of current debate, concerning the nature and the construction of climate models, as well as their predictive power. Moreover, it addresses the question how the uncertainty embodied in such models affects the decision-making processes at the level of public policy.

Weis, H Anne

Successful empires are seldom planned; they evolve. They typically have charismatic founders, able successors, and well-organized systems of administration. They satisfy core constituencies by ensuring supplies of staples or, for elites, luxuries and status symbols. They ward off potential unrest by various means, from moving populations to the cooptation of local elites, who control capital and production. The course looks at the phenomenon of the (ancient) empire from various points of view—the biographies of selected “founder figures” and the mechanisms created to ensure the survival of selected regimes, with less emphasis placed on bureaucratic structures and detail and more on the creation and maintenance of an ideology appropriate to the regime. A sense of tradition, for example, is essential to empire but only if combined with a sense of “modernity”—the projection of an ability to mobilize the latest in science and technology to preserve the benefits of empire for those who profit from it. Empires are, in this sense, “history-conscious”—they compare themselves with earlier empires and seek to surpass them. Empires examined include: Middle Bronze Age Akkad, late Bronze Age Egypt, Early Iron age Assyria and Persia, Classical Athens, Macedon, and early Imperial Rome. This is not a writing course per se, but it attempts, through feedback on a series of short, focused essays, to be written in class and/or out of class, and a Research Paper, to work with students’ ability to pose problems, work toward a solution, and articulate that process in writing.

The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrence that provokes a variety of human responses. In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death.

The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrence that provokes a variety of human responses. In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death. This undergraduate lecture focuses on the visual and material evidence of funerary practices and beliefs in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman societies. The subject will be approached thematically. First, we will explore how archaeologists discover death-related artifacts and how scholars approach the study and reconstruction of ancient death rituals. Ancient practices and beliefs regarding the mummification, the funeral, commemorative strategies, visits to the grave, and the afterlife will be explored, and images found on specific media (vases, sculpture, built tombs, paintings) will be discussed in depth. The course will conclude with discussions of the roles that sensational topics, like fear of the undead (zombies, vampires, and ghosts) and spectacles of death (gladiatorial contests and public executions), played in ancient Mediterranean civilizations.

This class has a twofold goal. First, it explores how the internal structure of words and sentences of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is built up in the light of recent developments of linguistic theory. MSA displays unique syntactic and morpho-phonological properties which make it fitting for cross-linguistic research. For example, its Morphology is non-concatenative, it has VS(O) and SVO word order structures and its sentences can be verbless and subjects can be left syntactically unrealized. Second, the class will also explore sociolinguistics dimensions of Arabic such as the communication style of Arabic, contextualization cues and social structure of MSA in different speech communities of Arabic, discourse strategies of Arabic, diglossic nature of Arabic, language contact, and language variation. Students in this course will learn about the methodologies and tools that linguists use to analyze languages with particular emphasis on Arabic data. The curriculum of this class will essentially deal with ways of analyzing, understanding and interpreting the interplay of Arabic language structure and Arabic culture.

This seminar takes a philosophically motivated inspection of the sciences of the brain and nervous system in the late 19th and early 20th century. Figures such as the neurologist John Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911) and physiologists Herman von Helmholtz (1821-1894) and Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) established an explicitly mechanistic research tradition in brain science. As noted by Thomas Henry Huxley, as early as 1874, this research had radical implications for the understanding of mental causation and the metaphysics of mind and sensations.

This UHC course is a mixture of lecture and seminar, and is very much dependent upon student discussion and exchange. Usually, we will mix lectures and the Socratic Method to work through our materials and our experiences of these books and journal articles, whether we are reading them for the first time or re-encountering them. Each student will start the discussion for one class, offering a summary of what is important in the assigned readings and posing questions for discussion. (In Section III, on Wallace Stevens, those students who start the day’s discussions should begin by identifying and commenting on specific passages that seem relevant to the text or the scholarship on the poetry.) These opening discussions will count importantly in the class participation grade.

What is the best way to accommodate religious and cultural diversity within a nation-state and in civil society? How should individual rights to practice religion be balanced with communal needs? Should freedom from religion be protected as much or more than freedom of religion? These are pressing contemporary issues in many countries, including the United States, but issues of religious diversity and questions of how—and even whether--to tolerate religious minorities have a long history. In this course, we will examine the toleration of minority religions in particular historical settings, and the issues and problems (both doctrinal and social/political) that societies grappled with as they confronted diverse religious landscapes.  We will also use these historical precedents as a lens to examine contemporary examples of religious pluralism, diversity, and conflict. Case studies will mainly be drawn from pre-modern Europe and modern Europe and North America, but we will also look at Mughal and modern India and discuss religion in pre-modern China.

This course considers the essential three waves of feminist political thought in western tradition. The course moves from early feminist theorists to modern concerns and questions over whether the Third Wave of political feminism is still going strong or it is more helpful to discuss a "Fourth Wave" of feminism. The course concludes with a project for students to explore how to tackle real political gender norms in an applied fashion, generating theoretically-grounded policy and behavioral changes for the world around them.

This course surveys European prehistory from the early peopling of the European landmass until the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of Vikings and Anglo-Saxons. Geographical coverage will include Western, Central and Eastern Europe and southern areas including parts of the Mediterranean and Aegean. Emphasis will be placed on investigating major changes in social organization, cultural contact and exchange, technology and economy. Key developments covered will include the rise of complex hunter-gatherer-forager communities in the Post-glacial period, the emergence and spread of agriculture and megalith building in the Neolithic, the impact of metallurgy, Iron Age ‘Celtic’ developments, the expansion, influence and collapse of the Roman Empire, and the rise of the post-Roman World with Viking and Anglo-Saxon migration and colonization processes. This course will provide a foundation for students interested in archaeology, history, ethnic history, art history and classics.

We learn the basics of Swedish language structure and everyday words and phrases, as well as proper pronunciation. We practice all four language skills and after completing the course, you will be able to talk about yourself and your life, read and comprehend simple texts, write short texts and understand short conversations about familiar topics using present or past tense. Examples of topics we cover are greeting phrases, going shopping, interests and hobbies and how to talk about what you do in your spare time.

This course focuses on gender and social work, beginning with a critical examination of the concept of feminist practice, with attention to oppression, power, and privilege in helping relationships and in women's lives more broadly. It explores meanings of gender as it intersects with race/ethnicity, class, sexuality, age, and ability in the lives of women in general and specifically as social workers and clients. Taught in a seminar format, this course examines topics such as work, welfare, family, violence, justice system involvement, health, mental health, and women as agents of change and is appropriate for students concentrating in micro or macro levels of practice.

How can we understand our world? In western culture, science dominates all our answers to this question. But there are other ways. They can be found in the mythologies of ancient and modern peoples. This course will compare the scientific and mythological ways of seeing the world and their more subtle connections. In particular, we will turn to the remarkable events in Ancient Greece of 800-400 B.C. and discover how the scientific approach actually grew slowly out of mythological thought itself.

The birth of quantum mechanics at the eve of the twentieth century marked a revolution in our classical understanding of the physical world. Such a theory successfully accounts for the phenomena taking place at the microscopic level. Yet, what the theory tells us about fundamental reality is still far from clear. This course focuses on the philosophical problem arising from quantum mechanics. In particular, we shall discuss various interpretations of the theory. Particular emphasis will be given to the issue of non-locality arising from the notion of entanglement, which is responsible for some surprising phenomena, such as quantum teleportation.

GOD HAS A HISTORY. IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THAT HISTORY, GOD WAS WORSHIPPED AS ONE OF A PLETHORA OF DEITIES CONTROLLING VARIOUS SPHERES OF COSMIC ACTIVITY OR THE HUMAN WORLD. STUDENTS IN THIS COURSE WILL LEARN ABOUT THIS ANCIENT PANTHEON—HOW GODS FUNCTIONED IN SOCIETY AND HOW THEIR PRESENCE WAS EXPERIENCED BY THOSE DEVOTED TO THEM. THEY WILL THEN TRACE THE EVOLUTION OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL FROM A MOUNTAINTOP DEITY OF THE SOUTHERN LEVANT IN THE LATE SECOND MILLENNIUM BCE TO A SUPREME DEITY WORSHIPPED BY A SMALL GROUP OF ABSOLUTE MONOTHEISTS BASED IN JERUSALEM IN THE MID-FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE. STUDENTS WILL BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED READERS OF BIBLICAL TEXTS IN THE PROCESS. THE SOURCES OF THE HEBREW BIBLE REFLECT NOT A HOMOGENEOUS MONOTHEISM, BUT RATHER A DIVERSE SET OF BELIEF SYSTEMS TENDING TOWARD HENOTHEISM OR EVEN POLYTHEISM. BY APPROPRIATING AND REINTERPRETING THE RELIGIOUS MYTHS OF THEIR NEIGHBORS, THE ISRAELITES ARRIVED AT A CHARACTER OF THE DIVINE THAT HAS PROVEN PROBLEMATIC TO MANY CONTEMPORARY THEOLOGIANS, PARTICULARLY ON ISSUES OF LGBT RIGHTS, WOMEN’S RIGHTS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

This course will focus on the global ramifications and impact of the African Diaspora. It will examine the historical roots of the African Diaspora and the triangular relationship between the African homeland and its European and American Diasporas. The central thrust of our study will incorporate the political, economic, cultural and intellectual frameworks for conceptualizing the American Diaspora. Of particular importance will be an examination of the role of the trans-Atlantic slave trade played in the creation of a new global economic order and its impact on the Diaspora identities. In this respect, the dialectical relationship between Africa and its Diaspora will be examined, using movements such as Pan-Africanism and cultural productions such as music and fabrics as case studies. The teaching method will combine lectures with a colloquial format.

African Literature And Society

The advent of independence for the vast majority of African states dating back to the 1950s sparked a lot of discourses ranging from those that dealt with political ideology, cultural relocation and/or dislocation, tradition versus so-called “modernity,” to others that focused on the literary functions and roles in the emergent context. This course focuses on African Literature and society and examines the inextricable linkage between the subject matter and the multifarious issues writers, mainly novelists and polemicists, address in their writings. As a subject matter, the course conceivably spans several epochs in the history of the continent. During this semester, however, we shall focus on post-independent Africa and discuss how African writers along the lines mentioned above have sought to participate and influence discourse on the complex and challenging dialogue on the imperatives of development, the locus of culture in post-independent Africa, and visions of desirable societies in Africa.  We examine writers from various geographical regions in the continent and determine the extent to which the issues they address seek to raise and/answer questions surrounding the African development problematique.

Studio in African American Poetry and Poetics will be a course in interdisciplinary making, as we investigate the evolving fields of African American poetry and poetics through a critical and a creative lens. In this class, we will think and work across genres (poetry, prose), mediums (page, canvas, digital, film, or theatrical space), and disciplines (writing, literary criticism, visual arts, drama, choreography, history, etc.), and collapse the walls between presenter and audience, creator and critic, as we work individually and collaboratively toward new modes of making. Intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates, this course will also provide students with hands-on opportunities to work on events, archival projects, and community outreach, and consider these activities from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Twyning, Amy

The novels of Jane Austen and those of the Brontë sisters, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne are classics of enduring interest to scholars at the same time that they garner quantities of fans from each new generation. Contemporary culture abounds in film and television adaptations and literary versions and revisions, such as Bridget Jones’ Diary, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and Here On Earth. Collectively, these authors’ works offer a master class in point of view, narrative structure, and novelistic discourse. Further, their work offers complex accounts of women negotiating worlds in which their self-determination is significantly curtailed. Together, the novels of Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters offer rich material for critical and historical examination of gender and sexuality, of the intersections of class, race, and gender, and of the relationship between representation and politics. The historical and regional separation between Austen and the Brontës also offers a condensed survey of the significant economic and social changes that characterize the first half of the 19th century in Britain. The majority of the course readings will come from the works of Austen and the Brontës but should include critical perspectives on the work. Students will gain skills in close reading, historical and critical analysis, and literary critical writing.

This course takes a problem-oriented approach to the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and related tools in archaeology.  We will cover concepts, case studies, theoretical issues, and analytic techniques useful for addressing particular kinds of questions about the relationships among archaeological sites and between people and the land they inhabited.  Topics include catchments and resource use, travel and transport over terrain, visibility, hydrology, locational modeling, and networks and spatial syntax.  Students may choose to participate in an optional lab component on ESRI ArcGIS software or to work with Idrissi and AutoCAD.  It is expected that students will have taken Archaeological Data Analysis II and be familiar with techniques for the acquisition and management of spatial data, the use of vector graphics, rasters (including map algebra), and spatial statistics. The course pairs well with ANTH 2541(Regional Settlement, Communities, and Demography), and students are encouraged to take the courses sequentially.

One of the unexpected byproducts of the proliferation of new media platforms is a renewed appreciation of the book as a richly complex medium for literary expression. A book is never simply a neutral container of literary content: it both constrains and enables literary practices. This course will seek to develop an understanding of the book as a complicated material object, the product of specialized divisions of labor and diverse publishing practices of making, formatting, distributing, and selling physical copies of texts. There will be several hands-on exercises in making—and unmaking—books as well as directed research in Hillman Library’s Special Collections on the history of book production. We will investigate the relationship between the format of a book and various literary forms: how, for instance, does publication of a novel in serial numbers influence its style? And we will explore literary texts that play seriously with the book, including poetry by Blake and Dickinson, contemporary artist’s books, Danielewski’s House of Leaves, and some born-digital texts.

In Professional Writing in a Global Context, you will consider English and the various possibilities for its use on a global scale.  Readings will introduce you to English as a world language and will critique its possible ramifications such as whether this practice can lead to what some critics are calling "linguistic imperialism" and "intellectual colonialism."  On a more practical side, we will also focus on creating and presenting documents for a global audience.  You will learn about the differences in international audiences and how to communicate successfully with those audiences.  This course will enable you to write with respect for another country's business, cultural, religious and social environment as well as its history and traditions.

Ames,Barry Charles

This course is a reading seminar designed to introduce graduate students to the basic literature on political questions and problems in the Latin American context.  The course will focus primarily on the question of how regime transitions (in the 1990s), and increasing methodological sophistication (over the last two decades) have triggered a change in the dominant paradigms for the studies of Latin America.  The first part of this course deals with classic approaches to the study of Latin American politics:  modernization theory, dependency, bureaucratic-authoritarianism, political culture, and macro-historical comparative strategies.  The second part emphasizes the new agenda brought by the third wave of democratization:  electoral behavior, political institutions, and governability.  We will also explore the relationship between politics and economic reform, and institutions and policy outcomes.

Pittsburgh has had a checkered past when it comes to air quality issues, and faces an uncertain future. Once known as "hell with the lid off" due to industrial emissions, Pittsburgh and its environs once had some of the worst air in the nation. In 1948, a noxious cloud killed 22 in nearby Donora and sickened thousands. But Pittsburgh also became one of the first American cities to pass legislation aimed at cleaning its air. Today it faces a new threat from emissions from coal-burning utilities in Ohio and west Virginia. This course is one in a series that focuses on the history, progress and current events of environmental issues in southwestern Pennsylvania that also have application throughout the region and U.S. emphasis is on a balanced presentation of the issues, discussions of various approaches to solving problems and development of writing skills. To accomplish this, the course will (1) focus on a single environmental issue, (2) structure individual classes around a single aspect of that issue, (3) feature guest lectures and presentations by government regulators and policymakers, interest groups, corporate leaders and experts.

This graduate seminar centers on research exemplifying rhetorical criticism. The course concentrates primarily on interpretive and critical approaches for studying instances of rhetorical communication in their historical and cultural context. The seminar critically examines relationships among messages, authors, audiences, and cultures. In other words, you will become acquainted with practices and methods of rhetorical criticism as practiced in the United States during the twentieth century. The seminar concentrates on major approaches to the analysis and interpretation of persuasive messages ranging from speeches to symbolic action. In addition, you will demonstrate your ability to perform rhetorical criticism by employing conventional research methods to conduct a sustained study of a significant rhetorical message or series of closely related messages. The method of instruction includes lecture, discussion, and practice workshops. Considerations of gender, sex, race, sexuality, age, and class will be interwoven throughout the course materials and discussions. Evaluation: You will write short papers every third week plus a final, formal paper which enlarges one of them. These papers will employ a conventional research practice to perform a rhetorical criticism of a significant symbolic message or series of related messages, which you select for study throughout the term.

This is a cross-disciplinary seminar taught by a humanist and a physician. This seminar brings critical theory into close dialogue with forms of medical knowledge and practice. It offers students the chance to examine the medical construction of the body—the meaning, function, and social place medicine gives to the body--vis-à-vis drugs (licit and il-), disease, treatment, medicalized gender and sexuality, and the discourses and practices of medicine upon ‘pathologies.’ The basic concepts for studying medicine’s power to construct the body are ‘biopower’ and ‘biopolitics.’  We will begin by reading basic texts on these concepts.

This course examines the role of lawyers in American society from colonization to the present day. It explores not only the trajectory and implications of lawyers’ increasing dominance of the domestic legal system over some four centuries, but also their huge and sometimes problematic influence over the basic constructs and shifting patterns of American politics, business, letters, education, communication and war, an influence that has allowed lawyers (not businessmen, not doctors, not professors, not clergy, not engineers…) to largely define what it means to be an American.  It considers how ordinary citizens and members of other professional groups have reacted to lawyers in their many social incarnations, and it assesses how embracing and occasionally rejecting their self-appointed role as “essential Americans” has affected lawyers themselves. It concludes with an investigation of where lawyers stand in American society today, assessing whether they have succeeded or failed in their larger ambitions to lead, and how they might better serve both society and themselves in uncertain times.

In political Psychology, students are exposed to a number of diverse "psychological" explanations of political behavior.  We begin with a conventional "rational-actor" approach (which assumes that individuals make political decisions based on rational criteria) and then explore a number of competing approaches such as psychoanalytic, behavioral, social learning, and social psychological theories.  Throughout the semester, a great deal of attention will be paid to the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various models.  Political behavior (that which we will attempt to explain) is treated quite broadly in this course, and includes political attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and actual behaviors of both masses and elites.  We will pay particular attention to leadership and followership.  (American field)

Students will have the unique opportunity to assist in the planning and implementation of an exhibition that will be held in the late fall in the Frick Fine Arts Building's gallery space. In Fall 2017, the exhibition will focus on the Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning.  We will explore the Rooms and their history through thematic questions about nationalism, immigration, and identity, and build an exhibition that addresses both the past formation of the Rooms and the future of these spaces as they continue to grow and evolve.  This course will also include a general introduction to key concepts within museum studies and curatorial work so that students may gain a broad understanding of the many facets of successful exhibition planning, design and implementation. In addition to helping to organize and install the exhibition, students will be expected to participate in class discussions based on weekly readings, conduct independent research on objects related to the history of the Nationality Rooms, write wall texts, labels, and other didactic materials for the exhibition, and submit a final portfolio of materials created during the class. Beyond the usual course workload, this seminar requires a significant commitment of time outside of class, including team meetings, installation, gallery activities, and de-installation responsibilities. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, though preference will be given to undergraduates pursuing the minor in Museum Studies.

What happens to personal and cultural memory when people emigrate or are displaced from their homes? Memory and Migration looks at how transnational narratives of migration interrupt a nation-based political, cultural, and literary paradigm. We will examine a variety of texts through the theoretical frameworks of border studies and memory studies, in order to challenge the boundaries of these disciplines and "migrate" their knowledges beyond the Southwest United States and discussions of Holocaust. In addition to critical writings, primary texts include the writings of Nicole Krauss, Roberto Bolaño, Yuri Herrera, Li Young Lee, Virgil, Isabel Wilkerson, Edwidge Danticat, Gish Jen, Ana Menèndez and Jhumpa Lahiri. Beyond literary texts, the course will look at theater from dramatists such as Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal, global music from Greek Mirologi to Brazilian funk carioca, and films such as Kent Mackenzie’s The Exiles and John Akomfrah’s The Nine Muses. Students will gain an overview of the fields of memory studies and migration studies while examining two fields in transition: immigrant literature and ethnic studies. Students will have the opportunity to add material to the syllabus and can base their final project on their main areas of study, providing they are relevant to the theme and materials of the course.

This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

This studio and workshop course will offer students the opportunity to explore and create composed and composited storytelling in digital media. While our projects may run the gamut of writing styles and genres, our primary work will focus on non-fiction narrative expressed through blog, podcast, video, and networked website creation.  To this end students will work on the development of texts with attention paid to the rhetorical modes and communicative platforms that specific media encourage. Students will also learn how to use audio and video editing software as well as basic HTML and website editing software. While previous experience in these practices is not necessary, solid access to reliable and sufficiently powered computing is required as will be access to quality software packages.  Pitt labs offer all of these services.  Students should anticipate a very heavy workload as the course will not only serve the work of the “writing”  (including scripts, images, videos, linking, and editing) of narrative but also serve the work of learning new software and textual mark-up language.  Students are encouraged to contact Prof. Jamie Skye Bianco in advance of the course regarding software requirements and to consult her website at www.spikenlilli.com.

Lucas, Susan

	On May 23, 2007, for the first time in human history, more of the world’s population became urban than rural. This course explores two related aspects of global urbanization: changing patterns of urban growth and urbanization, and similarities and differences in the nature of urban processes at the regional level. This course begins by exploring the causes of urbanization, factors driving urban growth, impacts of globalization, and regional variations in urbanization levels at a variety of scales including the global north and global south. In contrast, the second part of the course focuses on the differences and similarities in the characteristics of the economic, social, demographic, and cultural processes that shape urban places and urban life in different regions of the world. The optics covered include, but are not limited to, residential and commercial gentrification, residential segregation, gated communities, common interest developments, and sustainability.

CRITICAL MAKING

	
TuTh / 04:00 PM-05:15 PM / 206CL
Zachary Horton

The Maker movement is an emerging social and media form that is at once highly networked and post-digital. Making is situated at the intersection of social media, the online gift economy, and a participatory, interventionist engagement with one's physical environment. Drawing on open source ideals and innovation structures—the free sharing of code to enable collaborative development—making has become an attempt to democratize material culture through networked access to tools. MakerSpaces and MakerHubs have become critical nodes in efforts to materialize the virtual gift economy of the Internet. In this course we will engage the intellectual and practical roots of this new medial and social form and engage in our own critical making projects, utilizing scanning, modeling, and 3D printing technologies. We will begin by looking at the history and philosophy of open source software development, and then the political, social, cultural, and technological developments that have together given rise to critical maker culture. We will then learn some of the basic tools of scanning, modeling, and 3D printing. After initial modeling and printing assignments, students will form groups and develop collaborative final projects that involve materializing complex conceptual relationships from a topic of your choice. The aim of this course is to “close the circuit” between creative conceptual production, social networking, and materialized object relationships. Critical making is about critically engaging and creatively remaking the world around us. No prior “making” experience is needed. By the end of the semester, you will become a critical maker in the medium of your choice!

The primary focus of this course will not be on cinematic representations of historical wars, but on theorizing the convergence of military and cinematic technologies, taking as one point of reference the significant body of writing produced by Paul Virilio, including his War and Cinema. Issues to be considered include the intersecting military, medical, and cinematic uses of the scope and the screen, theories of human vision and ocularcentrism, new conceptions of space and time, the temporal convergence of production and exhibition (speed), new media technologies, and the blurred boundaries of war and entertainment.  In this course and in your research papers, we will explore a visual field broadly conceived as constituted by military/medical and cinematic/entertainment technologies. Some of the technologies we might consider include radar, infra-red imaging, weather mapping, virtual reality, medical imaging, x-rays, reconnaissance/aerial photography, and drone images, looking specifically at films that substantially use such imaging or theorize these intersections.

Because of civil wars in several parts of the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, the international organizations have reshaped their development agenda by emphasizing the importance of security and peace as preconditions for development. This approach was explicitly included among the aims of the United Nations by(then) Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his roadmap for the implementation of the UN Millennium Summit. In parallel, the concept of human security has been promoted by several Western governments, NGOs and independent commissions in order to take into account the need to address not only state security needs but also the vulnerability of individual humans in crisis situations. Aid policies have taken into account these evolutions, though the concept of human security itself has been discussed in a controversial way. The European Union is progressively integrating it into its security agenda and has started 'securitizing' its development agenda and African policy, including instruments like the Cotonou convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific states.

In recent years religious groups and religious values have played an increasingly prominent role in politics in many countries, including the United States. The purpose of this course will be to consider the public and political aspects of religion in the United States. Religious beliefs and institutions have wide-ranging implications for civic norms, public policy, political leadership, international relations, and the treatment of various social groups. After an historical survey of the role of religion in American politics, the second part of the course will focus on the contemporary impact of American religious groups and values on public opinion, lobbying, and electoral choice. We will also discuss the implications of the doctrine of "separation of church and state" for law, education, and civil liberties.

This course offers an in-depth and comparative examination of Mormonism and the Nation of Islam: two vital religious movements that emerged among diverse populations in the United States at representative moments of dynamic transition and migration in American history. Furthermore, both traditions have served to reify and affirm the coherences of race and nation—“blackness” for the Nation of Islam and “whiteness” for the Mormons. Both groups build upon standing religious traditions (a proto-“Judeo-Christianity” [in all of that term’s complexities] for Mormonism; Islam for the Nation of Islam, revising them extensively according to historically specific American contexts (the Second Great Awakening and Manifest Destiny in the early American Republic for Mormonism and the racial dynamics of Jim Crow that fed the “Great Migration” of African-Americans from the rural South to the urban north in the early twentieth century for the Nation of Islam). Furthermore, both groups claim fantastic myths of origin (Joseph Smith’s golden tablets and Wallace Fard’s tale of Yakub the evil scientist) that correct perceived historical misconceptions (Jesus appeared to the Native Americans, generating an “American gospel”; the role of Africa as locus of glorious past and future ideal). Both also remain controversial to this day for maligned social attitudes, practices, and the ways in which they have been, at times, unfairly misunderstood. Together we examine the histories, theologies, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and cultural contributions of these two groups aiming to understand how and why they emerged and what they have to say about religion and its relationship to race and nation in American transnational contexts.

This class, a graduate seminar also open to advanced undergraduates, introduces students to psychoanalytic writing with a focus on the prominent French feminist Julia Kristeva’s influential work on motherhood in “Stabat Mater” and on abjection in Powers of Horror.   Readings include psychoanalytic theory and practice in a number of fields such as philosophy, art history (Terry Smith is one of our guest speakers), religious studies (Paula Kane will also visit), communication, and film studies along with literature.  The course gives emphasis to questions of gender and race in the work of Hortense Spillers and Jack Halberstam. A practicing psychoanalyst, Kristeva has written an astonishing variety of texts, including novels, cultural theory, and case studies with great impact on artists and scholars in the US.  The course offers the opportunity to submit an abstract to give a paper leading to possible publication at the Kristeva Circle conference held here at Pitt’s University Club on Oct. 27-28 where Spillers and Halberstam are keynote speakers.  We will examine the reception of and resistance to Neo-Freudian thought in the US including the new directions in which American writers have taken it.

Croot, Cynthia

This course focuses on the extension and enhancement of basic acting skills using exercises based in a version of the Stanislavski acting system.  Utilizing exercises from great teachers like Michael Chekhov, Stella Adler and Uta Hagen, students will learn to perform scene work within emotionally invested circumstances, improve moment to moment and talking and listening skills, play objectives, and apply given circumstances to character development.  This course is a building block and prerequisite for most other acting courses in the theatre department.

Studies in Aristotle

Lennox, James G.

Recently philosophers engaged in inquiry in ethics, metaphysics, and philosophy of science have been explicit in acknowledging inspiration from Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition, often identifying their projects as “Neo-Aristotelian”. In this seminar we will do a selective examination of work in this genre, focused not only on the merits and shortcomings of that work itself, but also on its connections with Aristotle’s philosophical inquiries into the same or related topics. It is hoped that a clear (or clearer) answer will emerge to the question, “What is it to be an Aristotelian (or “Neo-Aristotelian”) in the 21st century?”.

17th Century Topics

Hogg, Chloe

Theater, Aristotle tells us, is about action (or more precisely, the imitation of an action). It is also about emotions and sensations: pity and horror, shivers and tears. The theater of 17th and 18th-century France combines action and feeling to pose ethical questions: What is the place of emotion in the state? What do you do when public duties clash with private attachments? Should you rebel against or should you serve power? We will study early modern theater as a laboratory for testing out responses to such ethical and political questions. You will read some of the masterpieces of French classical theater as well as lesser-known—yet deeply interesting—plays that date from the beginning of absolutism to the French and Haitian Revolutions. Coursework combines creative assignments (designing a theater or “producing” a play) with literary analysis and the use of digital humanities tools. Course taught in French.

Bondar, Greg

The course carries three credits and satisfies the Arts & Sciences skills requirement for Quantitative and Formal Reasoning. It is one of the very few courses offered at the University of Pittsburgh that are designed specifically to address the knowledge and skills involved in quantitative and formal reasoning within the context of the interests and needs of students in the humanities. The course meets three days a week for fifty minutes and involves a combination of lecture, discussion, and practical programming exercises. There are no prerequisites; in particular, students are not expected to have any prior computer programming experience and they are not required to know any foreign languages. On the other hand, as is the norm for courses with 1000-level numbers, students should have some experience with college-level study, especially in the humanities; this will assist them in identifying interesting humanities research questions, which they will then explore with the computational skills they will acquire in the course. Students may enroll under any of the cross-listed rubrics and both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. Whether the course satisfies requirements for a departmental major is up to the individual departments, and interested students should inquire about this with their major advisors. For undergraduate students, the course carries a University Honors College (UHC) designation. For more information about UHC courses, see http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/courses. For information about enrolling in UHC courses, see http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/course-eligibility. In addition to CourseWeb (Blackboard), this course has its own web site, which is located at http://dh.obdurodon.org.

This intensive writing course investigates the relationships between property rights, environmental law and policy, and social justice.  We will begin with an analysis of the tragedy of the commons, the nature of property rights, and the extent to which property rights do (and do not) address the tragedy of the commons.  We will then consider current issues in law and policy that involve the intersection of property rights and environmental quality and/or social equity, and will consider approaches being used to manage these issues. Student writing projects will take the form of essays/thought pieces; the course will include writing instruction and opportunities for revision of student writing projects.

Economic Development Of The Middle East And North Africa (MENA) Region

El-Hamidi, Fatma

Nowadays, Countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the area comprising the Arab States, Iran, Israel, and Turkey, face enormous economic challenges in the Twenty-First Century: Stagnant real wages, deteriorating competitiveness, and rapidly growing populations and labor forces, have left most countries in the region unable to afford soaring living standards to much of the society. Yet the opportunities facing the region have never been greater: world trade is growing rapidly, capital flows to most of these countries have never been higher, and regional integration options are many as the result of the European Union's agreement for a free trade area in the Mediterranean. Why after years of negative per capita income growth, has the region been unable to accumulate sufficient reform momentum to sustain economic growth? Do important differences across countries hold lessons for the future? What are the social consequences of economic stagnation, and how might future adjustment costs be managed to protect the poor? How have individual countries in the region defined the challenges ahead? And what issues must be addressed to realize a more prosperous future? This course is designed to expose students to current views by academics and policy makers on past practices and future challenges facing the economies of the MENA region, as a set of developing countries that share a common heritage but also show countless differences. The emphasis will be on developing an overall understanding of the origins and nature of various economic problems while at the same time providing a critical examination of existing and alternative development policy formulations in MENA. The course will focus on population growth and the impact of demographic changes on employment, poverty, and income distribution; agriculture; education; capital formation; labor migration; economic liberalization; the rise and fall of the oil-based regional economy; the economics of structural adjustment and reform; economic regional integration and the challenges of globalization; as well as gender issues.
