MoWeFr / 02:00 PM-02:50 PM / 00318 CL
    

         Combined with LING 1579 This course is an advanced introduction to phonological description and analysis. Students become familiar with the prevailing theoretical proposals on various aspects of phonological structure including sound systems, assimilation, syllable structure, prosodic structure, stress and tone. Students also learn how to evaluate the relative merits of these proposals by testing them on sets of phonological data. This course should provide a solid basis for conducting further phonological research.

    Ricketts, Thomas

         Logic concerns itself with demonstrative reasoning, reasoning in which the premises of the reasoning imply the conclusion.  Implication is in turn a matter of form or structure.  One statement implies another if the logical structure of the two statements guarantees that if the first is true, then so is the second.  The study of logic then begins with an abstract analysis of language designed to reveal the logical form of statements. Armed with our analysis of logical form, we will proceed to a rigorous definition of implication and develop formal methods for ascertaining the implication of one statement by others.  The logical techniques the course introduces will give students an enhanced awareness of the logical structure of English statements, and so contribute to their ability to analyze critically both their own reasoning and the reasoning of others.

         In this course, we will explore three things that might contribute to a good life: happiness, virtue, and justice. We will draw on historical and contemporary sources to think about what each is, about what it takes to be happy, to be virtuous, or to be just. And we will explore the ways in which happiness, virtue, and justice support one another, and the ways in which they stand in tension. Must we be virtuous or just to be happy? If not – if happiness can come apart from virtue or justice – which ought we pursue?

This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below). Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence.

         Undergraduate Seminar exposes the students to various aspects of being a physicist, a scientist and a responsible educated citizen in ways that academic classes do not teach. A variety of topics representing a wide cross section of recent discoveries in physics and related areas of natural sciences, history of scientific progress, outstanding scientists of the past and present, the role of science in society and many other themes are discussed. Students present reports on topics of their choice and moderate the discussions that follow. The Seminar aims to teach the culture of searching for new scientific information, to distinguish between good science and bad science, to apply analytical approach to obtained information, to boost one's confidence and speaking abilities when making public presentations and to help one learn how to be critical of oneself and how to identify one's weak spots. Students prepare posters for the Spring Undergraduate Research Fair.

         This is the second term of a two term Honors College introductory demonstration-lecture course in physics. The calculus is used in this course and the syllabus is essentially the same as Physics 0175. However, the scope of Physics 0476 is broader than that of Physics 0175 and subjects are covered in greater depth. Approximately half the term is spent on classical electricity and magnetism. Other topics include Einstein's special theory of relativity and introduction to modern physics and quantum phenomena. Three hours each week are devoted to lecture-demonstration and two hours to discussion and application to problem solving. This course is especially suitable for physical science majors, engineers, or any student who seeks an in-depth treatment of introductory physics in a calculus-based course.

         This course is intended to introduce advanced undergraduate students to modern physics experiments in a realistic research environment. Since the course requires a small number of experiments, each can be done with significantly more depth than normal undergraduate labs. Although there is a standard set of experiments and measurements, individual initiative from the students is encouraged. Recent projects include optics studies with a laser, radioactivity analysis, Mossbauer effect, study of scintillator properties with cosmic rays, Stern-Gerlach effect, atomic physics of the laser, pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance, and study of onset of chaos effects in a resonant circuit. Modern experimental techniques are emphasized, including the use of high vacuum technology, modern particle detectors, and small computers. A weekly lecture covers the physics of various experiments, the proper treatment of data, and related topics. In its 3-credit version (1626), this course qualifies as a W-course. The additional work associated with the extra credit is to be devoted entirely to a more comprehensive report writing. Students are expected to engage in substantive revision of their reports in response to the instructor's criticisms of the quality of the writing. The minimum amount of writing must reach a total of 20-24 pages for the term.

         This survey will follow the same format as Russian 0800, except that the readings will focus on four major twentieth century writers: Bely (Petersburg), Pasternak (Dr. Zhivago), Babel (Red Calvary), and Solzhenitsyn (Ivan Denisovich). Stories of more contemporary writers will also be read, including Bitov, Trifonov, Iskander, Sinyavsky, Petrushevskaya, Tolstaya, Shukshin, and Voinovich, depending on availability. Emphasis will be placed on the variety of prose narratives popular in the twentieth century, and on the emergence of new problems and perspectives and their expression in the twentieth century. This course is offered both as a sequel of Russian 0800 and as a separate course. It will presume some knowledge of literary styles, forms and devices which were discussed in Russian 0800, or in another equivalent literature course. A course in Russian or Soviet history is recommended, though not required. Students will be expected to revise their papers.

         This research seminar enables students to engage in a semester-length project to analyze an aspect of urbanism in an international city—the empirical focus this semester will be on capital cities in Southeast Asia.  Students are expected to draw from the skills they have assembled in Urban Studies and other courses to develop and conduct research on these important cities.  The writing-intensive course will include lectures exploring Southeast Asian urbanization, and workshops on developing the necessary research skills to implement research on distant cities.  Participants will become familiar with the conditions and challenges facing contemporary Southeast Asian cities, and with the extent to which comparative analysis is possible between this set of cities.

         A sociological internship is a type of Independent Study in which the student is, in some sense, employed in a non-academic position (usually as a volunteer but sometimes for pay).  Student interns are sponsored, guided and evaluated by a faculty member (usually the Internship Coordinator).  Interns are also directly supervised by an appropriate person at the internship site.  The experience gained by the student must have direct sociological relevance.  The normal academic requirements of an internship include a research paper, a daily journal and regular communication with the faculty sponsor.

         Every instance of human communication is an event or experience that reconstructs our identities in real time. The purpose of this course is to examine nonverbal communication, or the ways we communicate without written or spoken words. Topics to be covered include body language, eye behavior, vocal inflections, dress and appearance, arrangement of objects in space, and use of touch and time as weapons of wordless communication. Additional topics include nonverbal communication with nonhuman technologies, such as smart phones, as well as the conditions and consequences of nonverbal communication across cultures. Evaluation will be based on written assignments and class activities, in addition to one oral presentation and one cumulative exam.

         Modern archeology draws much of its theory and goals from anthropology.  This course will show how archaeologists use the fragmentary traces left by past peoples to develop an anthropological understanding of their cultures.  We will explore the variety of ways archaeologists investigate such things as prehistoric diet, social life, politics, technology, and religion.  Topics to be covered include:  the nature of archaeological information, dating techniques, interpretation of material objects, and archaeological ethics.  Studies from around the world will be used to illustrate major principles in archaeological research. The course will provide an understanding of how and why we study past societies, as well as the unique contribution archaeology can make to understanding ourselves.

         Course objective: To encourage students to make connections between their undergraduate education in communication and their experience as an intern in the workplace. Special emphasis will be on relating theory to practice in a way that makes students conceptualize their broader education in a manner that makes it relevant and applicable to real world situations. To enroll, students must have the approval of the communication advisor (1119 CL or 1124 CL), be in conjunction with a professional organization, and relate to some aspect of communication. The seminar provides a bridge between a student's undergraduate education and the competitive workplace that they will soon be entering. The purpose is to provide a forum in which the classroom practices of inquiry, investigation, reflection, and oral and written communication become meaningful in the context of work environments, specifically in the communications and media industries. The student must work 12-15 hours per week for 3 credits. Internships receive an S/N grade. Students enrolled in this seminar will meet in person 2-3 times per semester. During the remainder of the semester, students will complete readings and very short written assignments on the class Blackboard site. Students are no longer required to find a faculty sponsor -- Dr. Guthrie will serve as the sponsor for all Communication interns.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

    Luo,Di

         What is art?  This introductory course, designed for students with no previous background in art or art history, is intended to probe this question – and challenge traditional assumptions -- while providing students with the skills to interpret works of art and architecture from a diversity of world cultures.  The course is designed to demonstrate some of the basic tools of analysis with which to approach works of art as material and aesthetic objects while also examining them as productions that negotiate with historical and cultural contexts.  The course also thinks pointedly about cultural difference and the ways in which art has been employed to define communities as radically particular while also answering basic human needs that connect people living in different times and places.

         This intermediate, three hour-per-week course builds on the skills acquired during the first year of study in French 1 and 2, while further developing linguistic and sociolinguistic competence in French.  Because the focus is on communication, the course is taught entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for French 3 are as follows: 1) speak French well enough to ask and answer questions in various situations beyond what is needed to simply "survive" in a francophone culture, i.e., the ability to talk about self and surroundings in some detail  2) understand enough spoken French to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations related to topics above  3) read well enough to understand principal themes and most details in simple literary and non-literary texts  4) write longer and more cohesive paragraphs  5) cultivate a deeper understanding of French-speaking cultures  6) gain a better understanding of how French works as a language.

    Perry,Dolores R

         Black and White Photography 1 is a practical and theoretical course designed to give an awareness and understanding of the technical and aesthetic implications of photography. It is a production course where students, through a series of lectures and laboratory periods, will learn the process of seeing (making an exposure) and the craftsmanship (making a photographic print) that are the fundamental aspects of photography. The lecture will be divided into three main categories: (1) Techniques: Students will be introduced to the technical problems of photography and acquire an understanding to the practical and theoretical aspects of the camera body, the lens, the aperture, the shutter, and film exposure. (2) Aesthetics: Students will study the theory and psychological implications of their own work and the work of many prominent, contemporary photographers which will be shown and discussed in the form of slides and slide/tape presentations. (3) Assignments: The emphasis will be on the students' individual approaches to specific technical and aesthetic problems. The laboratory period is initially for demonstrating film developing, analyzing the negative, making a print (contact printing and enlarging), and finishing a print (spotting and mounting). Individual attention is also a primary consideration for the lab periods. Students will be expected to spend 2-3 hours per week outside of their lecture and lab periods to complete assignments. A student who wishes to take this course must have access to a 120- or 35mm camera (preferably a manual type which has a full range of aperture settings and shutter speeds), and will be expected to purchase a developing tank, reels, film, and paper. In addition to the tuition a $70.00 course fee will be charged for supplies, chemicals, and use of the facilities. Must be in the School of Arts and Sciences to enroll.

         This class is excellent preparation for upper level classes. Its main focus is understanding how the Earth operates over long time scales. The first section looks at the natural processes that drive climate change over time scales of 100s to 100s of millions of years. Causes include everything from volcanic emissions to wobbles in the Earth’s orbit to changing oceanic currents caused by continental drift. The second section examines the geologic history of North America. This provides excellent context for future excursions across the U.S. and includes, for example, a surprising variety of explanations for the origin of our major mountain belts. The third section looks at the earliest history of Planet Earth. To prepare you for upper level written work, I assign a series of short papers that are extensively edited and that can be revised for improved grades. I also include a series of Excel spreadsheet exercises, which teach you how to use an incredibly useful program and provide practice doing practical, geologically relevant calculations.

         The Independent Study option permits students to design courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department writing courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         Even before the United States became a nation, authors began writing our collective history, shaping our national memory.  The stories we have told ourselves about the origins of the nation and its literature have been of key importance to the ways we understand our culture, landscape, and identity.  Yet, our "origin stories" are often complex - rife with invention, revision, distortion, and omission.  In this class, we will focus on specific instances of cultural meaning-making (or "traditions") in American literature.  Along the way, we will consider larger questions about the relationship between history, fiction, and experience.

         Nineteenth century Britain experienced immense social, political, and economic upheavals, with corresponding changes in the conditions of reading and writing literature. This course will focus on the emergence of women novelists and poets as major contributors to the literary culture of the time. We will devote roughly half the course to close and, I hope, passionate reading of now “classic” texts by Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, and Christiana Rossetti. But we will also attend with the same care and intensity several little studied works, some recently recovered, others still virtually unknown.  Students will do some archival research on various topics, culminating in a project in which they discover various forgotten or unread books for the entire class to read in the final weeks of the semester.

         This is the first term in a two-term lecture-demonstration sequence that presents the elements of both classical and modern physics. The emphasis of the course is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles rather than on mathematical formalism and problem-solving (although some attention is given to these aspects of physics). This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below) which should be taken after Physics 0110. Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence. Subjects covered in the course include: kinematics  Newtonian mechanics  heat and heat transfers  mechanical waves and sound.

         The course begins with a thorough investigation of regression and the general linear model, and then moves on to more advanced techniques such as logit and probit analysis, models for ordinal dependent variables, and instrumental variables and matching models for causal inference. Students will be exposed to the theory of these methods as well as to practical ways of using them in concrete research situations. There are two main goals of the course: to enable students to read, understand and critique existing quantitative literature in political science  and to have students acquire the skills to conduct original quantitative research in their own substantive field of interest.

         This is a self-contained course for students not majoring in the physical sciences. Lectures mainly deal with astronomical objects that lie outside the solar system. The properties of stars and processes in them are examined, including a discussion of the birth, evolution, and death of stars, and the formation of pulsars and black holes. On a much larger scale the properties and formation of galaxies and active galaxies, including exotic objects such as quasars, are discussed. Finally, the subject of cosmology and the origin and ultimate fate of the Universe are considered. Part of this course includes the requirement of one evening "field trip" to the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory. The purpose of these trips will be to tour the facility and, if possible, make observations with a telescope. On any one evening only a small fraction of the class will make a trip, so it should be possible to accommodate the students' evening schedules. A small percentage of the course grade will be based on participation in these field trips.

         This course focuses on the fundamental principles of learning and motivation, as derived predominantly from animal research. Emphasis is given to the empirical (and conceptual) processes underlying the facilitation and suppression of behavior: e.g., primary and conditioned reinforcement ("joy"), non-reinforcement ("frustration"), punishment ("fear"), avoidance ("relief"); and to the generalization and discrimination of these processes. This course is viewed by the Psychology Department as a foundation for many higher-level courses. Recitation: Laboratory sections are designed to demonstrate some of the behavioral principles described in the lectures by using virtual rats as subjects for conditioning, extinction, generalization, discrimination, etc. Lab work accounts for approximately one-third of the grade

         Students selected for the Institute of Politics Internship will register for this course for the experiential component of their internships. The purpose of the internship experience is to provide the student with direct exposure to the process of public decision-making. Each student will spend nine hours a week working with an individual or office directly involved in the policy making process. Students will be given specific responsibilities and will be expected to be an active and integral part of the office in which they are placed. The details and terms of each placement will be carefully worked out and agreed upon by the student, the placement supervisor and the placement sponsor. Utmost care will be taken to insure that the student is placed in a situation that will maximize his/her exposure to all office activities and that the student is not left unsupervised and uninvolved. Students from all disciplines may apply, but preference will be given to students in their junior and senior years. Students must report to their placement for at least nine hours a week and fulfill any agreed upon responsibilities. Students will also be required to keep a written journal which describes and analyzes their internship experience. To apply, contact, the A&S Undergraduate Studies Academic Internship Office (412-624-5428) or the Institute of Politics (412-624-1837). If you are selected, you will be issued a "Permission to Register for a Closed or Restricted Class" form.

         Sexology, the scientific study of human sexuality, has played a pivotal role in defining many women, lesbian and gay, transgender, and gender non-conforming people as abnormal, diseased, or mentally ill. The medical model of gender and sexuality has established itself as the authoritative way of talking about these bodies, taking away their voices in favor of doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists. This seminar will examine literature, autobiography, and poetry by women, queer, and transgender people across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that challenges or speaks back to the medical model, while imagining alternatives through writing and form. How have medical frameworks of illness, diagnosis, and treatment been deformed and reformed by these authors? And how do they make gender and sexuality new sites of personal and political knowledge that medicine disqualifies? The main writing assignment for this course will be an essay on a disease, condition, diagnosis, or mental illness of each student’s choice that they will explore through literary, autobiographical, or poetic work.

    Perry,Dolores R

         This course is designed for actors who would like to improve their craft by better understanding the differences between acting for the stage and acting for the camera. It will also be informative for film and television directors who would like to work more effectively with actors. Actor training traditionally uses stage scripts. Reading a film script is a different discipline, requiring an understanding of the process of filmmaking. The course will describe and demonstrate the contrasts between stage and screen acting in specific shooting scripts and follow that with appropriate script study, character analysis and exercise in film acting techniques. Each class will include lecture, videotaped examples of performances for analysis and critique and the practical experience of working in front of the camera. The stage provides an actor with physical space within which to work, but a camera provides framed space that must be experienced to be used effectively. The course will take the student through the process of filmmaking. Film and television scripts will be the principal sources of material for the practical exercises which will be videotaped for playback and critique. Additional requirements include preparation and rehearsal of scenes for taping in the class, outside viewings of film and television programs and written analyses of performances. In addition to the tuition a $35.00 course fee will be charged. Must be a student in the School of Arts and Sciences to enroll.

In so doing, the course takes full advantage of the resources of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Films and field trips attempt to bring the readings alive. As course materials are providing the students with the necessary concepts and information to understand the urban environment, the students will be developing their own investigative skills through group trips.

         This course introduces students to a wide selection of Indo-European folktales as well as to perspectives and the cultural background that help understand these tales. We will examine the aesthetic, social, historical, and psychological values that these tales reflect. We will discuss theoretical and methodological models in the field of folklore studies, including formalist, socio-historical, psychoanalytic, and stylistic perspectives. We will also analyze the continuing influence of this folk tradition on popular and high culture. Upon completion of this course, students should be familiar with a wide variety of Indo-European folktales, be able to discuss several approaches to studying them, be able to identify the most important motifs of these tales, be familiar with some of the most influential folklorists, writers, and editors of the tales, and be able to assess the significance of folktales for contemporary western culture.

         The overall purpose of this course is to examine models for understanding how social systems influence the formation and development of cognitive, social, and emotional competencies in African American children and youth. Toward this end we will sample studies which reflect the formative influence of family including consanguineal and fictive kin (microsystem), neighborhood including schools, religious and secular institutions (mesosystem), print and electronic media including video games (exosystem), and public values and policies at state and federal levels (macrosystem). The instructor will be responsible for orienting students on how to analyze assigned articles critically and for leading class discussion of assigned and supplemented articles drawn from the disciplines of black studies, political science, psychology, sociology, economics, and education. Throughout, we will explore how inequities in cognitive, social, and emotional development articulate with normative standards of truth and justice which are compromised at every level of the social ecosystem. Four teams will be formed to explore how implications of readings can be applied to help families, neighborhoods, communities, and media enhance developmental outcomes in African American children and youth. Finally, students develop recommendations for promoting cognitive, social, emotional development to a distinguished panel of community leaders and university scholars who critique their presentations.

Topics include drawing connections between molecular shapes and group theory in regards to MO's that support certain geometries of complexes. Bonding interactions are connected to spectral and chemical properties for molecules. Common structures of ionic solids and condensed phase materials, the acid/base behavior of ligands in both sigma and pi bonding modes, and introductory transition metal and organometallic chemistry are discussed. The interaction between a metal's dn configuration, its requisite ligands, its reactivity and structures of its complexes are stressed.

In this course we discuss the American (US) Criminal Justice System, Drinking on US College Campuses, and Hip Hop music.  We introduce fundamental, core sociological concepts in examining these three micro- areas of study.  Beyond that we bridge the three thematic areas in subtle ways that weave our sociological analysis with depth and by introducing cross-cultural links.  This globalization component is a powerful example of how connected our world is.  The format utilizes lectures, recitations, and assignments.

         This intermediate, three hour-per-week course builds on the skills acquired during the first year of study in French 1 and 2, while further developing linguistic and sociolinguistic competence in French.  Because the focus is on communication, the course is taught entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for French 3 are as follows: 1) speak French well enough to ask and answer questions in various situations beyond what is needed to simply "survive" in a francophone culture, i.e., the ability to talk about self and surroundings in some detail  2) understand enough spoken French to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations related to topics above  3) read well enough to understand principal themes and most details in simple literary and non-literary texts  4) write longer and more cohesive paragraphs  5) cultivate a deeper understanding of French-speaking cultures  6) gain a better understanding of how French works as a language.

         The goal of the field of machine learning is to build computer systems that learn from experience and that are capable to adapt to their environments. Learning techniques and methods developed by researchers in this field have been successfully applied to a variety of learning tasks in a broad range of areas, including, for example, text classification, gene discovery, financial forecasting, credit card fraud detection, collaborative filtering, design of adaptive web agents and others. This introductory machine learning course will give an overview of many models and algorithms used in modern machine learning, including generalized linear models, multi-layer neural networks, support vector machines, density estimation methods, Bayesian belief networks, mixture models, clustering, ensamble methods, and reinforcement learning. The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition behind these methods, as well as, a more formal understanding of how and why they work. Students will have an opportunity to experiment with machine learning techniques and apply them a selected problem in the context of a term project.

         This course introduces students to Russian fairy tales, a fascinating and productive genre of folklore that reveals a great deal about Russian traditions and modes of thought. Taking a psychological approach to the materials, the course examines not only the tales, but also the beliefs informing the magic world of these narratives. Since the humans, spirits, and beasts populating this world are richly portrayed in Russian art, a significant component of the course will consist of visual and audio representations of figures and scenes from fairy tales.

    Fest, Brad

         This course is designed to help students improve as critical writers by becoming more observant and discriminating evaluators of how they and others use language to interpret, judge, and ultimately shape the worlds in which they live. Students will be first asked to reflect on the behavior of critics they have encountered in an effort to define what they believe good critics do. They will then be asked to test their definitions through close attention to various writing samples, including material they select as well as pieces chosen by the instructor. In keeping with the belief that critical reflection and dialogue enable both individuals and groups to improve, the course is discussion-based, and class members' progress as writers will be its steady concern. This section is best suited for students familiar with basics of grammar and composition, interested in composing more responsible and effective written opinions, and motivated to participate in conversation about reading and writing critically.

Students work one-on-one with a consultant in the Writing Center, using the papers they produce in their Seminar in Composition as materials for discussion. Much of the work of tutorial sessions is determined by the needs of each student  and consultants report to Seminar in Composition instructors on students' participation in these sessions. Students in Composition Tutorial are graded S/N by their Writing Center consultant on the basis of a final portfolio. Students placed into Composition Tutorial cannot pass Seminar in Composition unless they earn an S grade in Composition Tutorial.

         This is a self-contained course for students not majoring in the physical sciences. Lectures focus on practical astronomy and provide a historical perspective of our place in the Universe. Phenomena that can be readily observed with the unaided eye or a small telescope are discussed. The historical perspective starts with the earliest views, and discusses scientific discovery as a process leading up to the modern idea of the expanding Universe of galaxies. Part of this course includes the requirement of one evening "field trip" to the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory. The purpose of this trip will be to tour the facility and, if possible, make observations with a telescope. On any one evening only a small fraction of the class will make a trip, so it should be possible to accommodate the students' evening schedules. Nominally, the trips will take place on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening. Bus transportation from the Oakland campus to the Observatory will be provided. A small percentage of the course grade will be based on participation in these field trips.

    Slammon,Robert Michael

         This course takes as its object of inquiry the ordinary, familiar, routine, and unremarkable stuff of everyday life, beginning from the premise that, rather than being insignificant or inconsequential, what happens in everyday life crucially structures the world. As well, daily life is structured by larger social phenomena. As such, the study of everyday life provides a lens through which to explore such themes as the workings and effects of power, social change or the lack thereof, social inequality, quiescence and resistance, ideology, identity and difference, norms and normativity, subject formation and subjectivity, and practices of meaning making. Our mode of analysis will be to bring sociological concepts and theory to the sites and practices of everyday life to refine our sociological thinking and our understandings of the world. Along with exposing students to different schools of thought with regard to the study of everyday life, this course will provide students with the necessary tools to defamiliarize and denaturalize that which might seem natural, obvious, and axiomatic. It also is designed to help students think about the relationship between social processes and the individual and about what is at stake in understanding how they mutually affect one another in any given context.

Students will begin by writing an original proposal based on an area of organic chemistry of interest to them. The proposal will include theoretical background, an experimental section (including cost analysis) and a section on expected results. The students will then order the appropriate chemicals and carry out their own research based on their original ideas. Students will be expected to report their results in both written and oral presentations. This course is for those students who will respond to the opportunity to do advanced work and to learn some sophisticated chemistry at the same time. It will provide excellent preparation for those interested in doing undergraduate research in chemistry and/or considering chemistry as a career. There is a lab fee.

         This course explores the transnational connections amongst different literatures, regions, and languages of the Americas, which came to be understood collectively with the 15th century European voyages as the "New World". We will raise such questions as: How does literature play a role in constructing people's visions of the world? What constitutes a literary tradition? In what traditions do the texts we read participate? How do those traditions overlap and differ? We will address these questions by reading several texts from the "New World," situating the texts with respect to one another, as well as to texts from the "Old World."

         Ancient tombs, crypts, frozen bodies, mummies, and graves have been the stuff of adventure and fiction. Yet investigating causes of death in the past, and studying how ancient peoples dealt with the dead, can tell us much about life in the past. This course will explore two topics: (1) archaeological approaches to paleopathology and morality patterns in past populations  and (2) using study of mortuary patterns (treatment of the dead) to reconstruct prehistoric social organization.

The decisions of households, firms, and governments are coordinated through markets in which prices adjust to keep buying plans and selling plans consistent. The U.S. economy relies mainly on markets to coordinate these decisions, although sometimes governments intervene. We will explore various social issues using the principles developed throughout the course. Upon completion of the course students will have a better understanding of economic problems, efficiency, laws of demand and supply, consumer choice theory, market organization, production and cost.

Our discussions will address these issues as we analyze stories, novels, and films focusing on vampires from a variety of critical perspectives, contextualizing the works in the cultures that produced them.

         This course examines Slavic and anglophone science fiction comparatively. It assesses how a given culture's dominant values are articulated in a popular genre that enjoys different status in the East (i.e., Eastern Europe) and the West (i.e., England and America). Those values emerge in works that imaginatively posit "fantastic" situations rooted in biological, spatial, and temporal explorations beyond those currently verified by science. On the basis of films (e.g., "The Terminator", "The Fly"), film clips, TV shows, novels (e.g., "Solaris", "The Futurological Congress"), novellas, and stories, we shall discuss such topics as progress, utopia, human perfectibility, the limits of science, and the nature of knowledge.

    Weikle-Mills,Courtney Anne

         This capstone course allows you to do upper-level work on children’s literature, YA, and youth media. As the name of this course is “Critical Approaches,” one of our main investigations concerns the very nature of “criticism.” Why do it, especially as concerns children’s literature and culture? Can criticism have a public impact? Or has criticism “run out of steam,” as several scholars and writers now argue? What is the opposite of criticism? Pleasure? Play? Can criticism be pleasurable or playful? Can pleasure and play be critical? This semester’s version of the course proceeds from the observation that children frequently appear in theories and criticism of American life, and that childhood can also be understood as a concept immune to or distanced from criticism, filled with pleasure and other frivolous activities. Perhaps stemming from the original metaphor of the U.S. as an “infant nation,” children have been figures for and indexes of national health, the national psyche, and national character. Simultaneously, real and fictional children have functioned throughout our history as interpreters of the culture, as key figures of the American critic. Reading key literary, cultural, and theoretical texts, we will examine the American child as a compelling object of critical attention and a participant (real or imaginary) in critical inquiries involving Americanness, as well as a figure for seemingly uncritical play. We will ultimately become critics ourselves, using the specialized knowledge that you have learned about childhood and children’s literature at Pitt to play with our books and to construct creative critiques. For that reason, this class is, at its heart, both a literature and a writing class—and we’ll be employing editing workshops so that you can get feedback as you work on both a short salon-style article and a self-designed capstone project.

         Most of us probably assume that literacy is necessary in order to live a productive and happy life in the modern world.  Learning how to read and write is "basic," right?  But what is meant by writing and reading?  What behaviors, knowledges, technological know-how, or skills are or have been included within those terms?   And in what sense "necessary"--for whom or in what ways? What use, in other words, has been made of literacy and what values have been assigned to such use in personal, social, political and historical terms?   What's literacy good for?  In this course we will consider multiple literacies as complex social practices that vary according to time and place-- contested literacies, only some of which are or have been typically acquired through formal schooling.  Our aim will be to challenge commonplace assumptions about the "proper" uses and values of literacy in order to think creatively and productively about educational, political, and personal alternatives.  This course is designed especially for students planning on careers in teaching-related fields.

         If you don’t think too hard about it, you might be tempted to characterize childhood’s books as inscribing an imaginative, idyllic realm of fun, fantasy and adventure, protected from the darker aspects of life and filled with light and hope. Surely such assumptions about the nature of children’s literature account for perennial complaints, like the one published a few years ago in the Wall Street Journal, that these days, books for young people have gotten alarmingly “darker than you were a child, my dear.”But in this course, which is intended to serve as an introduction to children’s literature as a genre, we will discover that for hundreds of years books for children have been full of dark themes. Themes like death. Even themes like the death of children. In this course, we will explore how and why authors of children’s literature have depicted dead kids in their work, and in the process we will learn that far from being an anomaly in the history of children’s literature, dead kids have often been central to it. Beyond our general goals of reading children’s literature analytically and historically, we will learn and use terms, concepts, and frameworks that will support students who want to pursue a certificate in children’s literature as well as students who want to study literature more generally.

         The goal of this course is to introduce you to cutting-edge research in history and philosophy of science. We focus on a particular issue in the philosophy of psychology and neuroscience – whether there can be a science of consciousness. It is now orthodoxy that consciousness and all other characteristic features of mental life are the result of processes in the brain and central nervous system. However, controversy rages as to the best way to tackle the problem of consciousness within a scientific framework. The course examines some of the different approaches currently influential in this field, and examines the historical background that has shaped the debate.

         In Swedish 4, we talk about topics like school and education, renting an apartment, going to the doctor and media/news. We work on grammar and language to be able to work with increasingly more difficult materials, novels and texts, and analyze differences between formal and informal Swedish. We learn more about Swedish adjectives, how to use the definite form as well as comparisons, as well as the future tense of verbs. After this level, you will be able to take part in small talk, follow along with news reports and carry out phone conversations in Swedish.

         It is undeniable that the world has become integrated through the globalization of social, political, cultural and economic activity.  Cities worldwide have been markedly affected by globalization, but in turn have played a role in the process. Using modernist ideology as a framework, this course will compare the economic, social, political, historical and cultural differences between different cities over time and space. Students will each choose one world city to study in depth.

         Our subject will be the traditional stories--myths, legends, and folktales--of the Greeks and Romans. Traditional stories are ones that, by virtue of some compelling attraction, manage to survive from generation to generation, so our main task will be to discover just what that 'compelling attraction' was. The creation of the universe, the first woman Pandora, the Twelve Gods and Goddesses, the theft of fire by Prometheus, Helen and the Trojan War, the foundation of Rome by Aeneas, and Ovid's fanciful metamorphoses are examples of the stories from our modern illustrated reader Classical Myth by Barry B. Powell. By way of providing a context for our stories, the instructor will also devote much attention to such topics as popular belief and superstition, cult rituals, sanctuaries of the gods, oracles and prophets, the conceptualization of male and female, sexuality, and the social and cultural basis of myth in general. Throughout, we shall examine the many theories about the meaning of traditional stories from antiquity down to our own day.

    Salzer, Kenneth

         What is literature? Is it meant to educate? Inspire? Heal? Entertain? Transcend or confront? Do the meanings found in a literary work come out of the individual reader's knowledge and experience, the author's intentions, or the structure and style of the work? In this course, we will engage such questions while reading a selection of poetry, fiction, and drama. These readings, from various historical periods and socio-cultural contexts, will be the basis for an exploration into the differences-often blurry and changeable-between "literary" and "non-literary" writing. At the same time, as we consider the uses, qualities, and effects of literature, we will examine, apply, and reflect upon a set of strategies for reading challenging creative works.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

    Chapman, Amanda

         This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals  press kits  editorials  informational Web sites  articles  and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

    Aziz,Jeffrey

         Of the perennial characters of fiction, the detective is a late arrival, appearing in the mid-nineteenth century, spreading and mutating in the twentieth and twenty-first.  A question for us, as we turn the detective’s lens back upon him, is to understand why such a character is produced at this historical moment.  What is the detective?  Why do we modern, urban types need him?  What happens when the detective herself transgresses boundaries of gender, race, or social class?  The course will trace a development from the early work of Edgar Allan Poe, through the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, to modern and even postmodern detectives, including such works as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon.  This course will explore the representation of social difference in detective fiction in registers of gender, sexual identity, and ethnicity, with a special emphasis on the representation of Jewish identity through such texts as Jonathan Safran Foer’s Everything is Illuminated and William Goldman’s Marathon Man.

         This course is an examination of a broad  range of social theorists, whose ideas have influenced sociology.  We will read selections of some of the major works of both classical (principally Marx, Weber and Durkheim) and contemporary theorists with the goal of understanding and critically assessing their leading ideas.  Part of this effort will be the task of understanding how the ideas of these thinkers arose in specific social and cultural contexts (i.e., what social problems they thought they were addressing) and in specific intellectual traditions (i.e., what preceding ideas they were borrowing from and bending to their purposes).  The course readings and lecture discussions will also emphasize the continuing relevance of these ideas by examining how they are used (in various modified forms) in some current examples of sociological research.

         In this seminar students will develop the critical skills of reading and writing history through a close examination of one fundamental theme in the history of U.S.-Latin American relations: the impact of U.S. intervention in the Caribbean and Central America during the early twentieth century. In the first half of the course, we will explore how historians have analyzed diverse forms of U.S. intervention and nationalist challenges to U.S. imperial rule. This focus will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the different ways of writing history. In the second half of the course, you will work on a research paper that examines a specific aspect of a U.S. occupation. Rather than simply analyzing the works of other scholars, you will work primarily with historical documents such as U.S. State Department records. Class assignments are designed to guide you through the process of researching and writing the paper. You will learn how to define topics and questions  find, select and analyze primary sources  decide between contradictory pieces of evidence  create clear and well-substantiated arguments  and shape a coherent narrative out of the many possibilities. No Spanish-language skills are required for this course.

         Public and Professional Writing (PPW) internships offer you a productive, substantive writing experience in which you learn from and contribute to the sponsoring agency, company, or project. You will also learn more about theoretical, social, or historical issues of writing in public and professional environments through your work in one-on-one meetings with administrators from the PPW program. And you'll have the valuable experience of presenting your reflections on your internship in some form to your peers. PPW interns spend at least 50 percent of their on-site time writing. They keep a journal, write about their experience, meet regularly with the associate director or director of the PPW program, and work with a Writing Center consultant on their final presentation. Interns can access a discussion board that allows them to share their reflections on their experiences and prepare for their presentations. Students commit a minimum of 12-15 hours per week to the internships and are expected to perform as reliable and responsible professionals. Students who are employed may petition to create their own internship, provided that it encompasses a new and distinct project and is not a part of a traditional workload.

The main topics of discussion include the nature of lexical and functional categories, constituent structure, the syntax of verbal, nominal, adjectival, and prepositional projections, thematic roles and argument structure, primary and secondary predication, the (spurious) distinction between complements and adjuncts and their licensing, case-assignment, agreement, implicit arguments, dethematized constructions, co-reference, long-distance dependencies, as well as coordination and ellipsis. Moreover, the syntax-semantics interface and "Logical Form" phenomena will be briefly dealt with. The debate over the question of representation vs. derivation will be a running theme throughtout. Although the main languages to be analyzed are English and Spanish, the study of syntactic variation will occupy a central place in the syllabus. A brief introduction to the history of contemporary syntactic theory is also contemplated.

         This section of the Short Story will be devoted to the readings from 19th and 20th Century Russian literature. We will spend a good portion of our class sessions discussing the readings. The authors we will read range from 19th century favorites--Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov--to 20th century masters--Babel, Zamiatin, and Zoshchenko--right up to the most popular writers in Russia today--from Solzhenitsyn to Petrushevskaya and Tolstaya. Russians have always valued the short story as a source of wisdom and knowledge as well as entertainment and aesthetic pleasure, as a resource for understanding themselves as individuals in a complex society, as a means for analyzing social behavior and psychological relationships, and as a place for airing cultural issues and matters of political and social concern. As we read and discuss these stories, we will be asking shy these authors selected the short story rather than poetry, the novel, or drama for their inventions and fantasies, philosophies, and teachings, and why and how they expressed their views and values as they did using particular forms of language, imagery, and narrative structures. We will compare Russian and American ideas and values, considering both our cultural similarities and differences. We will both discuss the shared themes expressed in these stories and try to identify their particular national stereotypes and peculiar "Russian" characteristics. We will examine common and uncommon emotions and passions, customs, and mores, beliefs, fantasies, and dreams. Finally, we will attempt to draw conclusions about our own values, feelings, assumptions, reactions, and prejudices and their sources as we respond to the expressions of issues and problems raised in the short story literature of a different and fascinating culture.

         Painting Studio 1 is an introduction to techniques of oil painting and diverse subject matter for compositional development and creative expression. Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting Studio 1. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit from the University of Pittsburgh Bookstore. Painting Studio 1 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

         Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure.

         What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework. Check the individual section to determine whether the section is a 'W' section.

         This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the core feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality.  In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach “theory” as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the practices that shape our everyday lives, rather than merely a collection of texts. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete organized written analyses that build on feminists who have come before us.

         This course provides a survey of the way that linguistics has been used to solve 'real world' problems. Some of these, like computational linguistics and the teaching of language, are intimately involved in language, even though they do not necessarily concern themselves with linguistic theory. Others, use linguistics as a tool to do their work. We will be concerned with understanding the various ways that linguistic theories have been used or neglected, and also with the implications of applied fields for linguistic theories.

Indp Study Public Prof Writing

 / - / 0317B OSC
    

         The independent study option permits students in good academic standing to design Public and Professional Writing (PPW) courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. The independent study must integrate both the theory and practice of some aspect of public and/or professional writing, and the student must conduct research that will allow him or her to contextualize the writing forms and content being studied. Students typically write at least 30 pages (or 7,500 words) over the course of the term, and revision plays a significant role in the student's work. In addition, the student and sponsoring faculty member define a reading list and other required research, which may include interviews or surveys. The student and faculty member will agree on other work, such as essays or documents and a journal or other response to the research. Whenever possible, the student will create a final document that can be used by an intended audience or in a professional portfolio. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is comfortable with the subject matter of the study and has worked with the student in the past. The specific form for requesting this faculty approval can be obtained from the Director or Associate Director of PPW in M-2 Thaw Hall. The form requires a description of the project you are proposing, what you expect to learn from it, the reading and research you will do, the products you will create as a result of your study, and the ways in which your sponsor will engage with your work. You should expect to meet with your sponsor at least eight times during the term. Please note that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         The Western in film, fiction, and television tells the central epic story of the conquest, settlement, and transformation of America.  It's full of adventure, opportunity, violence, shame and glory.  But not only cowboys and Indians, gold miners and outlaws peopled this story.  Its characters went West, and still do, for many reasons—foremost, for freedom.  They could escape the urban life, alienating jobs, social restrictions, health problems, sometimes the Law or a regrettable past.  They remade themselves.  The vast frontier with its rugged landscapes, wild animals, often resistant indigenous people, and daunting weather invited adventurers and tested their courage and resources.

The details and terms of each placement will be carefully worked out and agreed upon by the student, the placement supervisor and the placement sponsor. Utmost care will be taken to insure that the student is placed in a situation that will maximize his/her exposure to all office activities and that the student is not left unsupervised and uninvolved. Students from all disciplines may apply, but preference will be given to students in their junior and senior years. Students must report to their placement for at least nine hours a week and fulfill any agreed upon responsibilities. Students will also be required to keep a written journal which describes and analyzes their internship experience. To apply, contact, the A&S Undergraduate Studies Academic Internship Office (412-624-5428) or the Institute of Politics (412-624-1837).

         This upper level undergraduate capstone seminar is intended for senior-level Political Science majors. This seminar also contains an intensive writing requirement component consistent with undergraduate department requirements. The aim of the course will be for students to understand both the nature and exercise of executive authority in the American political system at both the U.S. federal and state governmental levels.  Although this course will overlap to some extent with PS 1212 (The American Presidency), it will also have a decidedly broader focus on the role of executive authority in the American political system. This course will focus on the constitutional basis of executive authority for both presidents and governors within the American separation of powers system  an analysis of both formal and informal powers underlying executive authority  and examinations of the role of both public opinion and elections in executive politics.  Potential substantive topics covered in this course include the selection/election of chief executives, the role of public opinion in shaping executive authority, policymaking, unilateral action, presidential organization, intra-institutional relations with the bureaucracy, staffing and appointments, inter-institutional relations involving Congress and the judiciary, and federalism.  Students will be assigned a combination of books and academic journal articles chosen by the instructor.  The pedagogic focus of this course will emphasize the role of incentives in the study of constitutional design, institutional choice, and presidential behavior from a rational choice paradigm. Students will be required to master elementary analytical-deductive modeling applications to existing theories of executive authority covered in this course.  (American Field: Capstone Seminar)

         As a continuation of French 3, this 3-hour course builds on the linguistic and sociolinguistic skills acquired in French 3.  The focus is on communication and instruction is entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for French 4 are as follows: 1) speak French well enough to ask and answer questions in various situations beyond what is needed to simply "get along" in a francophone culture, i.e., the ability to talk about self and surroundings with a bit of detail  2) understand enough spoken French to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations related to topics above  3) read well enough to understand principal themes and most details in simple literary and non-literary texts  4) write longer and more cohesive paragraphs  5) cultivate a deeper understanding of French-speaking cultures  6) gain a better understanding of how French works as a language.

         This is an introductory course on rhetoric and its role in society. We will examine various definitions of rhetoric, theories of rhetorical processes, and examples of rhetoric in action. The objective of this course is twofold: first, to give students a sense of the formidable role rhetoric plays in the construction of our social, political, and cultural worlds  second, to introduce students to a set of basic concepts that they can use to understand rhetorical practices. Note that there is also an optional honors recitation associated with this course.

    Machamer, Peter K.

         Mind and Medicine deals with problems and questions that arise in considering how the mind plays certain roles in medical theory and practice.  Of course, this means we must think about what the mind is. We will begin this course by looking at nature of emotions (particularly pleasure, fear, and empathy), how they might be explained, and see what role emotions play in judgments.  Then we shall move on to examine briefly the placebo effect, what it is, and how it might function.  From there we shall examine a case of a common mental illness, depression, and use it to examine the nature of explanation in medicine generally. We shall contrast such explanations with those given in evolutionary psychology. Finally, we will examine the some of the interrelations among certain aspects of mind, brain, and body.

         This writing-intensive section of Imagining Social Justice focuses on the evolution of dystopian literature. Students will define the characteristics, history and purpose of dystopian lit by examining examples of the narrative type written during the Twentieth century. The student will then compare the historical characteristics and purpose with those of dystopian literature written after the tragedy of 9/11. The course will end by extrapolating the future trajectory of the narrative type. As a writing intensive section, the course will require the student to practice significant levels of writing and revision, as well as basic competency in higher order argumentation skills.

         How can we best communicate with others in order to persuade them? How can we promote a position or product while maintaining high ethical standards? Advertising and fundraising require the same kinds of persuasive work, though they serve different rhetorical contexts  advertising takes place in for-profit settings, while fundraising takes place in nonprofit settings. Both attempt to influence the decisions people make about the money they spend, the attitudes they have, and the issues that shape our society. In this course, students will analyze and create the kinds of persuasive writing used in the fields of fundraising and advertising. Coursework will involve readings, discussion, brief papers that analyze and critique work done in the fields, a presentation to the class, and an original written project that can become part of a student's portfolio to show prospective employers. Students will have opportunities to have their work reviewed in class, to participate in discussions with people currently working in the fields, and to revise their written pieces for a final portfolio.

Students will then work with 35mm still cameras while studying photographic exposure and composition, super-8 motion picture cameras while making short film and mini-dv cameras as they create short video projects. Both film and video editing will be done in a non-linear digital environment. Students will deal with issues such as composition, image sequencing, camera movement, continuity, editing, and time/space manipulation. Instruction will cover the use of equipment and technical basics, but lecturing is kept to a minimum. Basic terms, the development of a visual language and creative possibilities are stressed. All equipment is provided. A limited amount of film and processing is also provided, but students pay for their own videotape and other expenses. Grading is based on student projects as well as written exams. In addition to tuition a $70 course fee will be charged. Must be a School of Arts and Sciences student to enroll.

         This course is a partial survey of some important strands in the Western intellectual history. We will start with ancient Greek speculations in cosmology, philosophy, and medicine. Then we will look at some important subsequent developments in these areas and how they were influenced by the Greek tradition. These include, among other topics, the magical tradition that flourished during the Renaissance period. The latter half of the course will focus on the profound intellectual transformations in the 17th century which constitute what we often call The Scientific Revolution. The great scientific achievements of figures such as Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton will be discussed in detail. Overall, this course is meant to provide a broad picture of some of the most important elements in the Western intellectual tradition and their interactions in history.

         We remember their gods in the names of days (Wodan’s–day, Thor’s–day, and Frigga’s–day); we celebrate, with an altered purpose, their great festivals at winter solstice and onset of spring  we use such disparate terms from their language as "law," "ransack," and "berserk"; and we name athletic teams after their intrepid pirates the Vikings  but still we know relatively little about the complex culture of ancient northern Europeans. This course will present a cultural survey from about 500 BC to about 1500 AD of this folk. Our sources will be the people’s own cultural artifacts: archaeological and anthropological findings, written sagas, oral ballads, traditional legends, customs, superstitions, place names, and language expressions. The course’s aim is to show how these artifacts reflect the cultural and personal values of the people who created and used them. Topics covered will include social organization, distribution of labor and wealth, the position of women and children in family and society, and the uses of supernatural beliefs to achieve worldly goals. Where appropriate, parallels will be drawn between modern northern European values and their formative myths from the distant past.

Writing For The Public
3 cr.
W	
Th / 06:00 PM-08:30 PM / 00231 LAWRN
    Kubis, Dan

         This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals  press kits  editorials  informational Web sites  articles  and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

         This course aims to continue students' development in all aspects of the Italian language, with particular emphasis on those skills and tools necessary for advanced literacy in written Italian. Students in this course will encounter, discuss, interpret, and analyze articles, songs, video, films, literary excerpts, and other authentic texts, leading to both a greater understanding of contemporary Italian culture and a greater mastery of Italian forms, vocabulary, and expressions. Special attention will be paid to vocabulary-building exercises, strategies for the focused and efficient reading of texts, and carrying out different kinds of reading for different purposes. At the same time, students will continue to develop their oral proficiency in Italian by discussing and analyzing broad contemporary topics, as they emerge from the course's assigned readings. This class is conducted entirely in Italian.

         GER 0004 is intended to follow GER 0003.  Students will continue reading longer and more difficult texts, complete the grammar review begun in GER 003, expand their vocabulary, and write longer and more complex compositions. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. Students may also be called on to work with web materials, complete both listening and reading comprehension assignments, and work on a group project. Together with GER 003, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

         This course will study methods in ordinary differential equations which are relevant to dynamical systems theory and the study of chaos. Theory will be coupled with specific model equations, such as the equation of a pendulum, which can support oscillatory, and in some cases, chaotic behavior. Students will lean how to use a computer program to gain insight into the solutions of the equation and then mathematical analysis to prove, or perhaps disprove, what is seen on the computer. Perturbation methods will be among the mathematical techniques considered.

    Weissberger,Barbara

         Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

         This course examines age-related changes in neurobiological systems, including motor, sensory, cognitive, and neuroendocrine. Emphasis will be placed on distinguishing biochemical, molecular, physiological, and behavioral changes associated with normal aging versus changes associated with pathologic conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease. Introductory lectures will discuss different theories of aging, how aging is studied in the laboratory, and how these relate specifically to Neuroscience.

         This course will examine consumer culture in the twentieth and twenty-first century U.S.  It examines advertising, the rise of the brand, and their roles in the commercialization of mass media.  Of particular importance will be the role that race, class, and gender have played in shaping consumer culture (and vice versa), as well as the significance of the shift from a society based on an understanding of citizens based on democratic practices to one based on consumerist practices.  One lens through which we will examine these issues is youth culture, and how youth identity formation is impacted by consumer culture.

         Korean 4 is the second half of an intermediate course on spoken and written Korean. It is catered for learners who have taken Korean 1, Korean 2, and Korean 3 or have equal level of Korean language proficiency of Korean and knowledge of Korean culture. The objective of the course is to equip students with communicative skills in speaking, reading, and writing with more complex structures in Korean such as various kinds of speakers' stances, evaluation, assessment, judgment and attitudes on the events encountered, and more complex relations between two events such as cause, reason, purpose, concession, intention, background, condition, etc. Korean 4 classes are divided into two parts: Lecture classes will include explanations of those conversational patterns in grammatical and pragmatic terms. The course also provides sociolinguistics and socio-cultural information especially when language is intimately linked with culture. Recitation classes will provide the students opportunity to practice strictly in Korean with various tasks and activities in most essential daily life situation. This means that students are expected to use the target language as much as they can throughout the course. Students will often be asked to make a pair or a small group in which they may interact with each other verbally. Students are expected to memorize the frame dialogues, vocabularies and expressions assigned by lesson with the help of CD-ROM in the Language Media Center (G17 CL) or on-line web site of the textbook and the workbook.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

         We will use reading and writing to think a lot about how each of us understands and navigates our world. We will think about family history, about language, and about place. Those things are important parts of how each of us is uniquely positioned as a reader and a writer. Our readings and discussions this semester will be invitations to think about how that positioning happens, and what results from it. From the start we will assume that we do not pursue a single correct way of reading, or a single correct way of writing  instead, we pursue the ways of reading and the ways of writing that will enable us to do what we want to do from the positions we inhabit, and with a recognition of the positions of the audience for which we write.

         The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

         This course is a survey of the field of psychology, with an emphasis on the application of scientific reasoning, the empirical method, and careful observation and measurement to the study of topics such as learning, information processing, the biological bases of behavior, individual differences, personality, motivation, social and group dynamics, developmental processes, and psychological disorders and treatment. In covering the methods, theory, and basic phenomena of psychology, this course will also emphasize applications of psychological principles to real-world issues, and to the problems faced in other related disciplines. Additional out-of-class research participation or an equivalent research paper is required.

         Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

Students will be introduced to basic communication skills, including physical and vocal presence in front of an audience. The course will also develop an introductory level of acting skill through the use of regular warm-ups, theater games, improvisation, and simple scene study. The class will culminate in the performance of a final scene. Scenes will be selected from a diverse range of playwrights and students will examine the political, cultural and social context of each play. The course will also provide an introduction to basic theater terminology, and foster the ability to respond to and reflect on theatrical performances.

    Turri,Scott A

         Painting Studio 1 is an introduction to techniques of oil painting and diverse subject matter for compositional development and creative expression. Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting Studio 1. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit from the University of Pittsburgh Bookstore. Painting Studio 1 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

         This course introduces students to a wide range of syntactic phenomena from a variety of languages, including, for example, case and agreement systems, anaphora, grammatical relations, phrase structure, and grammatical constructions which have been of theoretical interest, such as raising and control constructions and Wh-questions. The course will demonstrate empirical methods used by syntacticians in arriving at analyses of syntactic phenomena, including, for example, the role of grammaticality judgments and the construction of sentences to test for such things as constituent structure, the properties of subjects and objects, whether a verb is a raising or control verb, and the behavior of reflexive versus non-reflexive pronouns in a language. The course will introduce students to at least one method of formal analysis of linguistic phenomena, one of which will be some version of transformational grammar.

         The core course in finance focuses on how companies make sound investment and financing decisions, much of which is also relevant for individual decision making.

         Operations Management (OM) refers to management of operations of an organization. Operations entail the process of transformation of inputs into outputs using technical, human, and financial resources. For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

         Operations Management (OM) refers to management of operations of an organization. Operations entail the process of transformation of inputs into outputs using technical, human, and financial resources. For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

    Martis,John F

         Operations Management (OM) refers to management of operations of an organization. Operations entail the process of transformation of inputs into outputs using technical, human, and financial resources. For example, typical operations of a manufacturing firm like GM or PPG include product design, production planning, sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing scheduling and control, shop-floor productivity improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and overall supply chain design and management. The operations of a service firm such as airlines include asset acquisition, business segments and flight planning, flight scheduling and staffing, aircraft maintenance, hub operations, and overall productivity analysis and improvement. The critical role of OM in an organization's survival and growth has now been recognized even in less traditional sectors such as hospitals, banks, department stores, hotels and tourism, and government agencies. This course will introduce the students to the issues in managing manufacturing and service operations, and provide students with a tool-kit of analytical tools, frameworks, and models that they can use.

          This course combines the ideas from both pure and multicomponent thermodynamics.  It introduces molecular insight and the tools (including commercial software) for solving both simple and complex problems in phase and chemical equilibria.  The course will have a strong focus on multiscale analysis, for example, covering intermolecular potentials (molecular-scale) to aid students in choosing equations of state for novel materials (macro-scale).  Advanced topics covered include interfacial behavior, adsorption, and osmotic equilibrium.

         Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them  and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

         The purpose of this course is to provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary for careers in the health/fitness and wellness setting, such as corporate wellness or a personal training facility.  Specifically, students will obtain the skills needed to evaluate medical history questionnaires, administer preliminary health screening, administer fitness assessments, assess, design, and implement exercise programs for apparently healthy individuals and special populations, as well as skills needed to instruct various cardiorespiratory, resistance, and flexibility exercises.  This course also prepares students for the American College of Sports Medicine Health Fitness Instructor Certification.  This certification is considered the “gold standard” of all health-fitness instructor certifications and is required by many employers.

         This course is, quite generally, designed to provide students with a basic working knowledge of the basic goals of the Constitutional Framers, giving students an understanding of the purposes of the American political system  the essential structures (or institutions) within the American Political system, the behavior (broadly defined) of the actors within the American political system, the purpose and performance of the linkage institutions in the United States (possibly including political parties, elections, and interest groups); and the types of policies that are often produced by a system with the characteristics of those found in the United States.  Depending on the interests, area of expertise, and inclinations of the particular instructor, some of these may be emphasized more heavily than others.

         This is a survey course in which the biological bases of behavior are explored. The first part establishes principles of nervous system organization and function, including the actions of various addictive and therapeutic drugs on the chemistry of the brain. Major topics in the second part include: sleep and wakefulness  sexual development and behavior  motivation, reinforcement and addiction  learning and memory  emotions, stress and health. For each, research into possible brain structures and neurotransmitters involved in their control will be discussed. Emphasis is also placed on experimental techniques used to obtain relevant data and on the type of inferences which can be made from these experiments. Clinically relevant topics dealing with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, depression, schizophrenia and behavioral immunology are also covered.

The ideal student for this course is one who self identifies as having changed their career path at some point during the undergraduate years, the student who plans to take a “gap year” (or two) before deciding if graduate school might be an option and those who plan to go right to work after completion of their undergraduate degree.

    Manuck,Stephen B

         This course serves as an introduction to research design, with an emphasis on contemporary applications in clinical and health psychology. In addition to covering formal aspects of experimental design, the course focuses on the logic of empirical inference, critical review of existing literatures, derivation of testable hypotheses, and selection of appropriate research strategies. These goals are achieved in the context of a group "practicum" in research design. During the semester the class generates an articulated rationale, design, and protocol for each of eight research questions. The topics of these design exercises reflect areas of student interest, and each is targeted (via pre-selection by the instructor) for development as an examplar of a particular design alternative. Each candidate design is developed independently by teams of class members, assisted by assigned literature reviews, text reading, and class discussion. In the final weeks of the course, each student develops an individual research project, partly in the context of class presentation and participation, and presents a completed proposal (similar to a thesis proposal) at the end of the semester.

         This 5-hour-per-week course introduces students to the French language, and is designed to develop both linguistic and sociolinguistic competence in both spoken and written French.  Because the focus is on task-centered communication, the class is conducted entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for Elementary French 1 are:  a) to speak French well enough to describe, narrate and ask questions in the present about a variety of everyday topics such as family, work, eating and traveling  b) to make short statements and answer simple questions about the past  c) to understand French well enough to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations about everyday topics  d) to understand simple written French well enough to grasp main ideas and some supporting details  e) to write sentences and short paragraphs on everyday topics  f) to develop an awareness of French-speaking cultures  f) to understand, at a basic level, how French functions as a language.  This course is for students with little or no previous exposure to the language and its cultures.

         As a continuation of French 3, this 3-hour course builds on the linguistic and sociolinguistic skills acquired in French 3.  The focus is on communication and instruction is entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for French 4 are as follows: 1) speak French well enough to ask and answer questions in various situations beyond what is needed to simply "get along" in a francophone culture, i.e., the ability to talk about self and surroundings with a bit of detail  2) understand enough spoken French to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations related to topics above  3) read well enough to understand principal themes and most details in simple literary and non-literary texts  4) write longer and more cohesive paragraphs  5) cultivate a deeper understanding of French-speaking cultures  6) gain a better understanding of how French works as a language.

         This course examines how issues of gender and the position of women in society inflect the reading and writing of imaginative texts, shaping how they are interpreted and valued. We will consider how women writers must negotiate and transform cultural ways of reading and writing, how they write and are read in relation to their male contemporaries and predecessors, and how they engage the literary traditions they inherit. Readings will include a range of literary and cultural texts as well as essays in feminist theory.

         Junior Seminars are designed to expose students to a range of texts that cross traditional literary periods.  This one moves across several centuries, continents, and genres to explore the questions: How can we understand the relationship of aesthetics to politics?  How has literature participated in and deepened debates over what counts as political?  What have been the political claims made for different literary forms and genres, such as tragedy, realism, modernism, magical realism, the manifesto, etc.?  We will read texts ranging from explicitly agitational to deeply "personal" ones whose political relevance has been challenged. We will also read several critical, theoretical, and philosophical essays, and students will write critical essays of their own culminating in a substantial research paper.

    Bender,Gretchen Holtzapple

         What is art?  This introductory course, designed for students with no previous background in art or art history, is intended to probe this question – and challenge traditional assumptions -- while providing students with the skills to interpret works of art and architecture from a diversity of world cultures.  The course is designed to demonstrate some of the basic tools of analysis with which to approach works of art as material and aesthetic objects while also examining them as productions that negotiate with historical and cultural contexts.  The course also thinks pointedly about cultural difference and the ways in which art has been employed to define communities as radically particular while also answering basic human needs that connect people living in different times and places.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

    Huerta, Frank

         This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals  press kits  editorials  informational Web sites  articles  and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

         Sculpture Studio 1 is a broadly based course that introduces students to the expressive potential of modeled and constructed form. Throughout the course, students experience a variety of sculpture techniques and materials in projects that study certain characteristics of natural and abstract form. The principle goals of the course are to develop skills and to provide a basis for individual creative development. From this course, students should gain sensitivity in the observation of form, develop analytic and compositional skills and begin to formulate ideas through practical experience. The individual must purchase basic sculpture tools. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $30.00 lab fee.

    Thomas,Lenore D

         Intaglio printmaking is an introductory print course offered twice a year. Basic intaglio printmaking techniques are explored through the use of dry point, copper plate line etching, and aquatint. Advanced techniques are explored toward the end of the semester. The course is designed to explore "safe etching" techniques by avoiding or limiting the use of hazardous chemicals. Students will be instructed by demonstration and written instructions on the various processes involved. Students will be required to execute prints in each technique and to print limited editions of each individual work. Grading is based on class participation, creative expression exhibited through the image making of the individual print and the final technical execution of the print. The required editions will be evaluated according to archival standards of uniformity and quality. Students will have the opportunity to make use of professional studio equipment and facilities. This class meets twice weekly and requires considerable out of class studio hours. Regular class attendance is required. There is a $40.00 lab fee.

         Undergraduate Seminar exposes the students to various aspects of being a physicist, a scientist and a responsible educated citizen in ways that academic classes do not teach. A variety of topics representing a wide cross section of recent discoveries in physics and related areas of natural sciences, history of scientific progress, outstanding scientists of the past and present, the role of science in society and many other themes are discussed. Students present reports on topics of their choice and moderate the discussions that follow. The Seminar aims to teach the culture of searching for new scientific information, to distinguish between good science and bad science, to apply analytical approach to obtained information, to boost one's confidence and speaking abilities when making public presentations and to help one learn how to be critical of oneself and how to identify one's weak spots. Students prepare posters for the Spring Undergraduate Research Fair.

         Are there good reasons for thinking that God exists? Are there good reasons for thinking that he doesn't? In this course we will examine the chief arguments for and against the existence of God, as well as other topics central to philosophy of religion: the nature of religious language, the relation of faith to reason and the use of religious experience as evidence. Members of the class will develop a working knowledge of the issues by reading and discussing traditional and contemporary authors. Lectures will be used to initiate and focus discussions.

         Description: Current research topics in biomedical image analysis will be explored with an emphasis on applying geometry and statistics to image segmentation, registration, and visualization. The goal is for computers to recognize and measure anatomical structures automatically in 2d, 3d, and 4d from prior knowledge and image features.  Student projects will use (and contribute to) the national library of medicine visible human toolkit, a new C++/Open GL Library of proven and experimental methods being developed by a consortium of research institutions including our own.

         The course is designed to promote the development of writing skills through a writing-as-process approach. Class work and written assignments will include journal writing, grammar review, vocabulary development, and analysis of model texts. Based on close work with models, students will then craft substantial compositions, each illustrating a function (narration, description) or a genre (essay, film review). Attention will be given to helping students improve as writers by learning to analyze, edit, and revise their own work. Course taught in French.

         This course is designed to develop the students' awareness of the actor's process and to foster a general sense of theatre as an area of human endeavor. Students will be introduced to basic communication skills, including physical and vocal presence in front of an audience. The course will also develop an introductory level of acting skill through the use of regular warm-ups, theater games, improvisation, and simple scene study. The class will culminate in the performance of a final scene. Scenes will be selected from a diverse range of playwrights and students will examine the political, cultural and social context of each play. The course will also provide an introduction to basic theater terminology, and foster the ability to respond to and reflect on theatrical performances.

         Visual Thinking is an introduction into the process, and practice of making images. The broad scope of the subject is explored through lectures, discussions, critiques, and the process of making images. Students are introduced to the dynamics of composition, relationships of form and content, principles of color, aesthetic issues, visual analysis, perception, and the importance of visual choice, purpose, and creativity in an increasingly image-oriented culture. The course also seeks to provide some experience with a variety of media, develop skills in observation and technique, and encourage personal involvement in solving visual problems. Projects focus on preparation and planning, developing awareness of visual issues, understanding and applying visual concepts, and developing core skills and technique. The course offers a relevant introduction and insight into the process and practice of making art. This course is open to art majors and non-art majors. In-class productivity and participation, as well as significant out-of-class work are expected. The course requires the purchase of art materials and supplies.

         How can politics be studied and understood "scientifically"?  This course serves as an introduction to the methods of political science research. The course will begin with the logic of social scientific inquiry and the basics of research design, and then introduce students to the quantitative methods that are commonly used by political scientists to investigate important questions about the political world. The goals of the course are 1) to strengthen each student's ability to analyze, interpret, and critically assess real-world phenomena from a social scientific perspective, 2) for the student to become an intelligent consumer of political science research, with the ability to see the strengths and flaws of social scientific studies in academic journals and books, magazines, newspapers, and other media outlets  and 3) to give students the skills necessary to begin conducting original political science research studies of their own.

         Why do countries democratize? What role can international actors play in promoting democracy? In this course, students will engage with cutting edge research that seeks to answer these questions. We will focus first on the challenges and barriers to democratization, and the symptoms of “low quality” democracy that plague many countries around the world. We will then explore how the international community can best promote democracy, focusing on particular tools of democracy promotion, including election monitoring, foreign aid, and post-conflict reconstruction. Throughout the course, students will work on crafting an original research paper on a topic of their choice.

         This course allows students to explore the rhetorical implications of design and invites students to consider design and writing as an integrated process. The class will alternate lecture/discussion sessions with studio sessions, so that students can learn how to use Adobe InDesign to create both single- and multi-paged documents for particular rhetorical contexts. Students will also learn how to manipulate images in Adobe Photoshop so that they will better serve their purposes. Our classes will focus on theory of writing and design, critique and analysis of documents that students create, and critique and analysis of documents created by professionals.

         In The New York Times article “A Language for Grieving,” Sonya Posmentier writes, “By making violence strange and unfamiliar, very different poets like [Gwendolyn] Brooks and [M. NourbeSe] Philip have gone beyond merely repeating its effects, like a viral video of a police shooting, and beyond the realm of the evidentiary to that of the imagination, where we might not only observe violence but mourn and counter it.” I read this six months after attending a Cave Canem retreat where Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon emphasized the importance of joy in black life. “Our story is not abjection,” she wrote in a workshop handout. “That’s somebody else’s narrative. … Our anger is not ugly. Our joy is not absurd.”

         Foundations in Art History offers an introduction to the history of the art historical discipline and its research and interpretive methods. Other courses in the art history department introduce students to the 'what' of art history--major works and histories of the arts in specific time periods and geographic locations around the globe. This course, by contrast, is devoted to the 'how' of what the art historian does--how she or he interprets the work of art according to its specific characteristics, the place and time period in which the artwork was created, and the changing nature of viewers' responses to it.

As a graduate level course, students are expected have some prior elementary knowledge of social statistics.  This course will build on that knowledge, providing students with the necessary foundation to produce quantitative research.  Emphasis will be placed on the underlying assumptions and statistical principles of multiple regression analysis.  But, the skills acquired throughout the course will enable students to understand and critically evaluate several of the advanced research methodologies employed in the social sciences.  Students will leave the course with a broader understanding of the range of quantitative techniques they may employ in future empirical endeavors.

         Both among the best writers of their eras, Thoreau and Frost drew their material from New England--indeed, Thoreau was a substantial influence on Frost. But the appeal of each far transcends regionalism. Not that either author lacks detractors, for each had a rather prickly, eccentric personality, aspects of which are reflected in Thoreau's poetic prose and Frost's deliberately prosy poetry. What made Thoreau, once regarded as a minor disciple of Emerson's, perhaps the most widely translated American author in the world? How did Frost, who as a young man seemed headed for failure, end up as a national institution and America's most

Over 80% of the world's population lives in these countries and their economies are assuming an increasingly important role in the global economic system. The functioning of agriculture, industry, and international trade and finance will be outlined. Alternative government policy options will be considered. The effects of roles played by government, population growth, income distribution, health care and education in the process of economic development will be discussed. The course will concentrate on the economic aspects of development

         This course has two objectives: First, giving students hands-on experience responding to public policy issues by analyzing micro data. Second, providing students a level of intuition regarding appropriate tools for each level of analysis, and be able to criticize results of inappropriately used tools. A principal component of this class is an in-depth analysis of welfare measures (indicators, measurements, profiles, and policy implications). Students will use income/expenditure and consumption surveys to calculate and graph a range of indicators for different countries, compare government policies and reactions and conclude the extent at which policy implementation worked for the welfare of the poor. The goal is not to turn you into an expert in econometrics or regression analysis, but to provide you with a working knowledge of different techniques in these areas. Students will be “briefly” introduced to survey design and implementation, and engage in data management: modifying, reshaping, collapsing, combining, and working across variables  Data cleaning: dealing with outliers, duplicates, and missing variables. Most importantly, finding proxies (or generate indices) to replace a critical variable that is not available in the data or incorrectly handled at the entry level. The rest of the course will be devoted to answer specific policy questions, for example: 1) to what extent an increase (or an imposition of) a minimum/living wage would affect wage workers, as well as non-wage workers? which group is likely to suffer the most?; 2) do private returns to education differ by the number of years or by the certificate type (i.e. certification/sheep skin effect); 3) by analyzing the wage structure by industry/occupation/product type (using firm level surveys) we may find some clues on whether there is a mismatch between the skill level of workers and the demand for specific skills. The analysis may later recommend sectors of the economy that in need of intervention. The main statistical package we will be using throughout the course is STATA.

Students will learn to read critically and analytically, to make simple normative arguments, and to explain the specific role of normative arguments in political science and political life.  Depending on the interests, area of expertise, and inclinations of the particular instructor, some of these may be emphasized more heavily than others.

This course will explore the residual, colluvial, or alluvial genesis of landforms, and the development of a soil profile as a function of parent material, biological factors, slope, climate, and time. Major soil horizons and several sub-horizons will be studied for identification and description in the field using USDA methods and nomenclature. This course will also cover the use of physiographic provinces and geology maps, USGS topographic mapping, and the usefullness and limitations of the Soil Survey.  Examples of excavated archaeological sites on a variety of landforms and soils of various age will be presented, as well as the use of soils information to help interpret the environment at the time of occupation. The potential for different types of soil to contain archaeological sites, and appropriate Phase I testing strategies will be discussed.  Prerequisites: Only minimal knowledge of geological principles is assumed, but students should have taken at least an introductory-level archaeology course.

         This course offers an in-depth examination of the American Revolution, from the first rumblings of colonial discontent in the early 1760s through to the creation of an independent nation-state under a new federal government in the 1790s. In its approach, the course follows Carl Becker’s famous observation that the Revolution was both a question of home rule, as well as one of who should rule at home. In other words, it will treat the Revolution both as a war for independence whose causes and consequences unfolded within a broad geopolitical context, and as a violent social upheaval whose outcome determined the relative division of power between various social groups within the new nation.

         Like other Seminars in Composition, this introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. This particular seminar will include readings that consider issues of teaching and learning in American education, and for this reason may be of special interest to students who plan to become teachers. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, the course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing and education.

Students develop all four skills--speaking, understanding, reading, and writing with special emphasis on content useful in everyday communication. Recitation: In addition to the two lecture classes, students register separately for recitation sections offered five hours per week. These sections, taught by native Japanese speakers, are designed to provide further practice and reinforcement of material learned in lecture classes.

         The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

         This course introduces students to the issues associated with the teaching of English language with special attention to instruction at the K-12 level.  Topics include language acquisition and development, standard and non-standard dialects, and issues of composing and analyzing language.  A primary consideration of the course is the way historical and cultural forces influence the teaching of English and shape evaluations of what constitutes "correct" and "literate" uses of language.  The course can be used to fill teacher certification requirements

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

    Fischer, Lucy

         This capstone course designed for senior Film Studies majors focuses on two concepts central to current theoretical discourse in the field:  “media” and “spectatorship.”  Although students will have surely encountered these terms in previous courses, this seminar demands an in-depth, advanced investigation of their formulation and intersection in order to discuss contemporary debates at the heart of film studies scholarship.  What does it mean to be a spectator of cinema?  Is the film spectator different from the spectator of related media, such as television or digital art?  How do we “watch” with our bodies as well as our eyes within and across different forms of visual media?  Do certain genres apply pressure to theories of spectatorship relying on psychoanalytic, cognitivist, phenomenological, or other conceptual frameworks?  How do issues of gender, nation, history, identification, and reception shape our notions of both media and spectatorship?  Demanding, critically complex readings in film theory and film history will open up our discussion of such questions, and students will pose (and answer) questions of their own in essays, presentations, and weekly journals.

         Public and Professional Writing (PPW) internships offer you a productive, substantive writing experience in which you learn from and contribute to the sponsoring agency, company, or project. You will also learn more about theoretical, social, or historical issues of writing in public and professional environments through your work in one-on-one meetings with administrators from the PPW program. And you'll have the valuable experience of presenting your reflections on your internship in some form to your peers. PPW interns spend at least 50 percent of their on-site time writing. They keep a journal, write about their experience, meet regularly with the associate director or director of the PPW program, and work with a Writing Center consultant on their final presentation. Interns can access a discussion board that allows them to share their reflections on their experiences and prepare for their presentations. Students commit a minimum of 12-15 hours per week to the internships and are expected to perform as reliable and responsible professionals. Students who are employed may petition to create their own internship, provided that it encompasses a new and distinct project and is not a part of a traditional workload.

         This course explores the transnational connections amongst different literatures, regions, and languages of the Americas, which came to be understood collectively with the 15th century European voyages as the "New World". We will raise such questions as: How does literature play a role in constructing people's visions of the world? What constitutes a literary tradition? In what traditions do the texts we read participate? How do those traditions overlap and differ? We will address these questions by reading several texts from the "New World," situating the texts with respect to one another, as well as to texts from the "Old World."

Why can’t morality or justice rule directly? Why do we need human authorities at all? In the second unit, we ask what the state should do, exploring three prominent conceptions of political justice. And in the third, we will ask how the state should go about doing it, focusing on defenses of democratic institutions.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

         This course examines how issues of gender and the position of women in society inflect the reading and writing of imaginative texts, shaping how they are interpreted and valued. We will consider how women writers must negotiate and transform cultural ways of reading and writing, how they write and are read in relation to their male contemporaries and predecessors, and how they engage the literary traditions they inherit. Readings will include a range of literary and cultural texts as well as essays in feminist theory.

         This Capstone Course will be an involved examination of US collegiate sports from a political economy perspective, emphasizing wealth and power – including stratification theory – at its core.  We will conduct a critical examination of the role of sports in society, amateur and professional sports and how they affect our lives here in the US, with a cursory comparison to the rest of the world.  We will see the reach of the power of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and its unique political, economic and legal attributes.  This case study will allow us to see how sports affects how we see ourselves as a society and as individuals, including notions of class, race and gender – among other things.  The focus of my course is the political economy of sports – including the peculiar American NCAA and Power 5 college athletics.  This analysis will reveal all of the traits upon which this social institution sits – Capitalism.

In areas of scientific dispute, how do scientists and their allied interest groups attempt to overcome their critics? In the face of apathy or hostility, how do scientists and their allies try to convince the public, the scientific community and policy makers that their position is legitimate and worthwhile? What relevance does this have for current debates such as global warming, the global obesity epidemic, fracking, the anti-vaccination movement, and the medicalization of deviance? Attention will also be given to more exotic scientific struggles such as scientific creationism, the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the case for the existence of mermaids.

         The Physics and Astronomy Colloquium, held jointly with the Carnegie Mellon University Physics Department  provides an opportunity for all faculty and students to hear invited lectures and discuss problems of current interest to members of the Physics and Astronomy Department. The talks are intended for faculty and students from all areas, and thereby constitute a unifying element for the department. Also, talks of even broader interest are occasionally presented. The weekly one-hour Monday colloquium lectures are generally evenly split between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University throughout the course of the academic year. Registered students must make a short, 1-paragraph summary of at least 10 colloquium lectures to receive credit.

         The design process examined in this introduction to architectural form-making is concerned with context as a potential driver for architectural design and examines the relationship between building and the urban fabric in which it is situated. Context will be understood as physical and virtual, permanent and ephemeral, situational and circumstantial. Qualities of site, situation, and cultural context will be examined, raising issues that may challenge conventional approaches to architectural design. A series of procedural exercises will enhance students’ awareness of the complex and layered issues involved in architectural problem-solving. An intensive site research component will yield data that will be used to generate organizational systems – grids or patterns that will become the basis for planning a given site and generating building forms.

         Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them  and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

         This is a standard introductory course in microeconomics. It focuses on the way the market system works. The decisions of households, firms, and governments are coordinated through markets in which prices adjust to keep buying plans and selling plans consistent. The U.S. economy relies mainly on markets to coordinate these decisions, although sometimes governments intervene. We will explore various social issues using the principles developed throughout the course. Upon completion of the course students will have a better understanding of economic problems, efficiency, laws of demand and supply, consumer choice theory, market organization, production and cost.

Particular attention will be given to how personal ideology impact and reflect history, aesthetic values, socio-political values including race, class, and gender, and spiritual beliefs. Through this comparative study of dance, students will present their ideas of how to create “Change.” These objectives will be accomplished through lectures, video discussion, and dance.

         This course seeks to acquaint history majors with proper techniques of historical research and writing.  It does so by using a two-step method.  The first step is that students will read interpretive (secondary) works and primary materials on three case studies: the witch hunt of early modern Europe, the USSR’s anti-Trotskyist campaign of the 1930s, and the post-WWII U.S. anti-communist campaign, usually mislabeled as McCarthyism. For this section, students will also read primary documents and secondary readings.  Based on the readings from the early modern European witch hunt, the class will construct a social science model of the historical preconditions for and the characteristics of a witch hunt. Our goal in examining the three case studies is to investigate the ways in which historians use primary sources to craft an interpretation.  The second step is that students will conduct primary research and write a research paper on a topic agreed upon by the instructor and student.  The paper will relate to either a historical precondition or characteristic of a witch hunt, or to a comparative study.  The research will begin early in the semester so that students have time to write project proposal, to write a draft and revise it, then write a second draft and revise it before submitting the final paper.  Students will act as critical readers for each other’s papers.  The goal of the course is for students to experience first-hand grappling with conducting primary research, having to interpret primary sources, experiencing the process of writing and revision, and being a critic of others’ written work.

         This is a course for writers. Students will read a wide variety of contemporary nonfiction—memoir, literary journalism, science and nature writing, polemic and lyric essay. Together, we’ll read for ideas and inspiration—on subject and style—and we’ll explore the pleasures and responsibilities of being a writer of nonfiction, the art of fact. By the end of the course, students will have a sense of the nonfiction being written now and of where it comes from—its history and place in the genre—as well as a more expansive view of what’s possible in their own work.

The course will cover how English words, phrases, and sentences are put together, as well as current and historical trends that have led to English as it is used today. We will also address differences between prescriptive rules of how English "should be", and descriptive generalizations about how English actually is. Lecture format with class discussion.

         This course presumes that students have the knowledge base needed to understand materials issues associated with the design and operation of nuclear power plants, such as basic concepts of physical metallurgy, a mechanistic and microstructural-based view of material properties, and basic metallurgical principles.  This course will cover the metallurgy and phase diagrams of alloy systems important in the design of commercial nuclear power plants.  The micro-structural changes that result from reactor exposure (including radiation damage and defect cluster evolution) are discussed in detail.  The aim is to create a linkage between changes in the material microstructure and changes in the macroscopic behavior of the material. Also discussed is the corrosion of cladding materials as well the effects of irradiation on corrosion performance, as well as the effects of primary and secondary coolant chemistry on corrosion.  Both mathematical methods and experimental techniques are emphasized so that theoretical modeling is guided by experimental data.  Materials issues in current commercial nuclear reactors and materials issues in future core and plant designs are covered.

         Students in this course will culture microorganisms from natural sources such as soil, vegetables, and their own skin, and learn various methods while studying the organisms they have cultured.  The topics for the course include (a) survey of types of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and algae  (b) types of methods used to culture and study these microorganisms, especially bacteria, including aseptic technique  preparation of microbiological culture media  isolation of bacteria from natural source,  and cultivation of various types of microbes  use of microscopes and basic staining techniques  identification of unknown bacterial isolates  and (c) some practical applications of microbiology such as microbiological analysis of wastewater, and identification of clinical isolates. The exercises incorporate practice with (i) data analysis, (ii) commonly used computational skills needed by microbiologists, and (iii) safety practices for protecting the microbiologist, personnel on whom the laboratory depends (e.g. custodian and dishwasher), and the workspace, from microbial contamination. The curriculum includes a variety of standard methods that anyone having such a course listed on his or her transcript would be expected to know. There is a lab fee attached to this course.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

         This course is the continuation of first-year Chinese I. It is designed to enhance the Chinese proficiency in all the four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) of those who have finished one semester of CHIN class at the University of Pittsburgh or its equivalent. Students continue to develop the ability to communicate in Chinese through the consideration of essential cultural themes, language functions, and authentic situations as they acquire the structures and lexicon to work with written language, conversation, and composition. By the end of the semester, students should be able to conduct simple, practical conversations, and to read and write short passages on a variety of everyday topics such as transportation, dining, asking directions, lodging, travel, etc.

         An academic internship offers students a unique learning opportunity to connect classroom knowledge with real-world settings as they explore careers and gain valuable experience. Students may earn from 1-3 credits for an experience that can be related to an academic field of study. The experience must be pre-professional in nature and must be approved by the Dietrich School Office of Undergraduate Research. Students must seek out and apply for their own internship. To look for internships, log into the Pitt Portal (www.my.pitt.edu), go to em>Career Services, then visit em>FutureLinks, or contact the OUR. Students who are earning credit for ARTSC 1900 internships may not receive pay. Students must work at least 120 hours over the course of the term to be eligible for the maximum of 3 credits. In order to earn credit, the student must have a Dietrich School faculty sponsor (full-time only) who will assign related academic work. Internships are graded as S/NC.

         This course provides explicit instruction in the conventions of research writing in preparation for assembling a thesis based upon undergraduate honors research within the department.  In addition to using the functional and structural features of a written research report essential to communicating research findings as a model for the undergraduate research thesis, the students will also learn to evaluate the effectiveness of other people’s written communication, as well as their own, by analyzing the patterns in written English that help or hinder communication.  The ethics of scientific writing and the review process will also be explored.

         Molecular orbital and hybridization bonding theories are developed to allow the interrelationship of molecular structure, bonding, and trends within the periodic table to be applied to a large number of inorganic complexes and materials. Topics include drawing connections between molecular shapes and group theory in regards to MO's that support certain geometries of complexes. Bonding interactions are connected to spectral and chemical properties for molecules. Common structures of ionic solids and condensed phase materials, the acid/base behavior of ligands in both sigma and pi bonding modes, and introductory transition metal and organometallic chemistry are discussed. The interaction between a metal's dn configuration, its requisite ligands, its reactivity and structures of its complexes are stressed.

         The course will provide students with elementary logic skills and an understanding of scientific arguments.  Ours is an increasingly scientific and technical society.  In both our personal life decisions and in our work we are daily confronted by scientific results which influence what we do and how we do it.  Basic skills in analyzing the structure of arguments in terms of truth and evidence are required to make this type of information accessible and useful.  We hear, for example, that drinking alcoholic beverages reduces the chances of heart disease.  We might well ask what sorts of tests were done to reach this conclusion and do the tests really justify the claim?  We read that certain geographical configurations in South America "prove" that this planet was visited by aliens from outer space.  Does this argument differ from other, accepted scientific arguments?  This course is designed to aid the student in making sense of a variety of elementary logic skills in conjunction with the application of those skills to actual cases.

         In this section of Seminar in Composition, we will explore reading and writing by considering the interrelationship of college education and the community life of Pittsburgh. Students in this section will engage in service-learning, pairing meaningful service in the community with the academic work for the course. Throughout the term, the students will provide service with community organizations of their choice  students can expect to devote about 2-3 hours a week, for a total of thirty hours of service over the course of the term. Our discussions will focus on their experiences during this service work as well as their reflections on this experience as guided by a sequence of critical readings and short essay assignments. We will be working every week to read and discuss the essays that the students produce for this course. By considering these subjects in this community context, our goal will be to improve the essay-writing skills students bring to this course by helping them to become more critical readers and writers.

         The purpose of this course is to illustrate ways of looking at literary texts. We shall examine poems, prose works and plays from France and the francophone world, trying to answer some of the following questions: What are the characteristics of these different genres? What is specifically literary in the text? How can reading such a text make us more able to understand today's world? Considering these questions should make students more familiar with French-language literary production and also help them understand the literary phenomenon in general.

         Third Year Korean 2 is the second half of an advanced-intermediate course in spoken and written Korean. It is catered for learners who have taken Third Year Korean 1 or have equal level of Korean language proficiency of Korean and knowledge of Korean culture. The primary focus of the course will be on reading comprehension, vocabulary enhancement and discussion skills in which a wide range of topics/issues will be introduced. The course will also introduce approximately 90 Chinese-character words to provide not only for accurate comprehension of Sino-Korean words but also for better understanding of traditional and contemporary culture and society of Korea. Furthermore, the curriculum is designed to deepen the students' knowledge of Korean language and culture by exposing different speech/written styles, various expressions, vocabulary, structural patterns, Korean proverbs and idioms. The course is divided into two parts in which the Lecture Class focuses on acquiring the complex grammar patterns, building more sophisticated vocabularies and expressions, improving writing skills and writing/recognition of the Sino-Korean words whereas the Recitation Class focuses on developing advanced and intellectual speaking not only in interpersonal, but also in interpretive and presentational communication through a wide variety of interesting authentic materials.

         This is the second term in a two-term lecture-demonstration sequence that presents the elements of both classical and modern physics. The emphasis of the course is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles rather than on mathematical formalism and problem-solving (although some attention is given to these aspects of physics). This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below). Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence. Topics covered in the course include: kinetic theory  thermodynamics  electricity and magnetism (electrostatics to electromagnetic waves); geometrical and physical optics  relativity  quantum physics.

         This is a self-contained course for students not majoring in the physical sciences. Lectures mainly deal with astronomical objects that lie outside the solar system. The properties of stars and processes in them are examined, including a discussion of the birth, evolution, and death of stars, and the formation of pulsars and black holes. On a much larger scale the properties and formation of galaxies and active galaxies, including exotic objects such as quasars, are discussed. Finally, the subject of cosmology and the origin and ultimate fate of the Universe are considered. Part of this course includes the requirement of one evening "field trip" to the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory. The purpose of these trips will be to tour the facility and, if possible, make observations with a telescope. On any one evening only a small fraction of the class will make a trip, so it should be possible to accommodate the students' evening schedules. A small percentage of the course grade will be based on participation in these field trips.

         This course is a historical introduction to the religious traditions that developed in ancient Near East and the Mediterranean. Our major emphasis is on the history of the religious traditions that emerged in late antiquity in this area and which continue to be major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Zoroastrianism. We focus on key concepts, historical developments, and contemporary issues. Throughout the course, we also examine interactions among these religious traditions. In the last part of the course we examine the issue of globalization and the spread of these religions around the world as well as the presence of "non-Western" religion in the "West." The course also serves as an introduction to the academic study of religion and provides a foundation for further coursework in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. No prior knowledge of any of the religions studied is expected or assumed.

         This course is designed to introduce students to cultural anthropological methods and concepts that are useful for gaining a better understanding of human diversity.  We will examine such topics as family systems, economic and political change, religion and ritual in order to encourage students to question commonly held assumptions about what is "normal" and "natural" in human experience. Films, videos and slide presentations will supplement texts and lectures. Evaluation of the recitation sections will be determined by the recitation instructor. Attendance, class participation, projects and short quizzes will form the basis of the recitation grade.

         This class serves as an introduction to the major religious traditions of China and Japan (and sometimes India). During the course of the semester, we encounter the native Confucian, Daoist (Taoist), and popular traditions of China, and the Shintō, folk and new religions of Japan. Buddhism, which originated in India but later spread to East Asia, is examined in its relation to the history of both Chinese and Japanese religions. We approach these traditions through lectures and discussion based on Chinese classical and popular literature, secondary scholarship, and films, which inform us about cultural and historical context, beliefs, practices, and personal experience. In the process we expect to learn something about the ways in which non-Western religious traditions see themselves and their world on their own terms, and to see how/if they can complement our own worldviews.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

    Sobers,Sophia L

         Visual Thinking is an introduction into the process, and practice of making images. The broad scope of the subject is explored through lectures, discussions, critiques, and the process of making images. Students are introduced to the dynamics of composition, relationships of form and content, principles of color, aesthetic issues, visual analysis, perception, and the importance of visual choice, purpose, and creativity in an increasingly image-oriented culture. The course also seeks to provide some experience with a variety of media, develop skills in observation and technique, and encourage personal involvement in solving visual problems. Projects focus on preparation and planning, developing awareness of visual issues, understanding and applying visual concepts, and developing core skills and technique. The course offers a relevant introduction and insight into the process and practice of making art. This course is open to art majors and non-art majors. In-class productivity and participation, as well as significant out-of-class work are expected. The course requires the purchase of art materials and supplies. Due to the nature of studio practice, demonstration, and performance, it is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting. There is a $15.00 lab fee.

         This course addresses the key intersection between two important topics in contemporary political theory: Justice and Globalization. The first half of the course will cover the highly influential works of John Rawls as well as reactions from Robert Nozick, and Susan Moller Okin. The second half of the course will weave in the issue of globalization to questions of justice—again using Rawls’ work and various respondents as a vehicle for doing so. The course ends with a significant applied project on the intersection of globalization and justice that will challenge students to consider the current state of justice in a particular global case of their choosing.

         This hands-on course introduces students to key photographic concepts and the basics of shooting and editing film and digital video. It begins with a brief review of the Macintosh Operating System and some of its possibilities. (Students who are unfamiliar with Macs or with computers, in general, may opt to take 'Introduction to Digital' prior to this course.) Students will then work with 35mm still cameras while studying photographic exposure and composition, super-8 motion picture cameras while making short film and mini-dv cameras as they create short video projects. Both film and video editing will be done in a non-linear digital environment. Students will deal with issues such as composition, image sequencing, camera movement, continuity, editing, and time/space manipulation. Instruction will cover the use of equipment and technical basics, but lecturing is kept to a minimum. Basic terms, the development of a visual language and creative possibilities are stressed. All equipment is provided. A limited amount of film and processing is also provided, but students pay for their own videotape and other expenses. Grading is based on student projects as well as written exams. In addition to tuition a $70 course fee will be charged. Must be a School of Arts and Sciences student to enroll.

         In this course we will examine the contexts for and rhetorical dimensions of a variety of professional documents, including those documents students produce in the course itself. Major assignments include a set of career materials (resume, cover letter, career report); a correspondence packet that addresses a conflict  a proposal  and a longer report based on research and analysis. As we engage in this work we will explore the nature of professionalism, common features and efforts (enabling and disabling) of professional discourse, and strategies for negotiating the "borders" of specialized and non-specialized discourse.

         The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

You will work with techniques that are important in biology and apply these techniques to the investigation of basic biological principles emphasizing cell biology and fundamental processes of life. Students should have successfully completed college algebra. If the class is closed when you are enrolling, you should put yourself on the wait lists for multiple sections. The coordinator will not give permission for over-enrollment. While on the wait list, you must attend a lab section during the first two weeks of class so that you are not behind if you get into the class. There is a lab fee attached to this course.

         This is the first term in a two-term lecture-demonstration sequence that presents the elements of both classical and modern physics. The emphasis of the course is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles rather than on mathematical formalism and problem-solving (although some attention is given to these aspects of physics). This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below) which should be taken after Physics 0110. Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence. Subjects covered in the course include: kinematics  Newtonian mechanics  heat and heat transfers  mechanical waves and sound.

         The Independent Study option permits students to design courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department literature courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework. Check the individual section to determine whether the section is a 'W' section.

         This course will provide an overview of major sociological approaches to health, illness, medicine, and the body. The field of “medical sociology” is incredibly broad, and it would be difficult to cover all of it in a single semester. To that end, we will focus on a few topics. First, we will discuss the structure of the health care “system” and shifts in its organization over time. As we consider the health care system, we will also discuss the roles and identities of various health care professions and how they have changed. Secondly, we will focus on some of the sociological dimensions of medical ethics and the law. Last, we will investigate how the medical field informs and shifts our perception of the human body.

The course emphasizes theories, principles, and concepts of organizational communication and their practical application. Students learn to analyze the communication which occurs in organizations to recognize sources of communication breakdown and develop an awareness of strategies for prevention and/or resolution of communication on breakdown. This section is highly interactive and will be graded on the basis of participation, as well as self-assessment, goal writing, interview with a professional, resume/cover letter and marketing return on investment (ROI) assignments. A major component of the course is a formal, research-based case study analysis and presentation for a real client facing an organizational communication challenge

We use the textbook to continue learning more grammar, for example s-verbs, the passive voice and transitive/intransitive verbs, but the focus is, as always, on communicative skills. Examples of topics we cover are social media, travel and tourism, and working life, and we work on real life skills like writing job applications and resumes. We also study proverbs, slang, and swearwords – areas that require a significant knowledge of the language to be used appropriately.

         The relevance of Darwinian theory to the study of anatomy and physiology has been obvious for many decades. Only recently, however, have evolutionists begun to focus their explanatory tools on cognition, motivation, emotion, perception, relationships and family. This course will examine the rationale and future of evolutionary approaches to psychological phenomena. Initial lectures on the status of evolutionary theory will prepare students for the discussion and evaluation of evolutionary psychology that will follow.

         In this class we study the origins of constitutionalism in the Western world, in particular, due process, limited government, the rule of law, representative institutions, and individual rights. As unlikely as it sounds, we will find these origins, along with the basic tenets of the modern democratic polity, in the decidedly undemocratic Middle Ages. Our story begins with the emergence of the three bodies of law upon which the Western legal tradition was built, namely, Roman law, canon law, and English common law. The narrative includes forays into cultural history, for example, the emergence of universities where Roman law and canon law were taught and studied  political history, such as the emergence of the medieval “state,” the quarrels between popes and kings and kings and their nobility  and finally intellectual history, in particular, the political and legal ideas that constitute “the mental furniture of the mind,” those notions of justice, law, and reason that were axiomatic and against which sovereigns and subjects were measured. Readings will include excerpts from law codes, the writings of theorists such as Thomas Aquinas, and works such as Magna Carta. Our work will go forward on the basis of discussions and lectures. Much class time will be spent in small groups, where students are divided up and assigned a particular primary source to dissect and present to the class. In this way we will constitute a community of scholars who work together in a common intellectual endeavor, one that introduces us to some of the most significant texts in the history of Western constitutionalism. There are no course requirements for Medieval Law and Government.

         This course examines the origins and development of English law and legal institutions from c. 1000 to c. 1700, with a view toward understanding the foundations of the American legal system. Keeping in mind that law is shaped by social, economic, religious and political considerations, we attempt to answer the vital question, "How, and by what processes, did English society solve certain problems with which all societies must eventually cope?" In answering this question we will be concerned with the various mechanisms for resolving legal disputes (e.g., trial by jury, the common law writ system, proof and evidence); rights in land and personal property  and legal relationships between people (e.g., contract, marriage). In addition, we will deal with certain issues in English constitutional law (e.g., the rule of law, ideas of legal sovereignty).

We will look at political, diplomatic and cultural ties between the two nations in the 20' century, ranging from the American "occupation" of Britain during World War Two to the Beatles and the British Invasion of the 1960s to popular and journalistic impressions held of each country in the other. We will read some primary sources, especially newspapers, speeches and memoirs, but mostly will read several of the very good books published on the subject.

         This course explores the theory and practice of writing that serves the public interest. Public writing is crucial in the nonprofit sector, serving every kind of cause: safety and health, political activism, the environment, animal rights, the arts. It also takes the form of writing that facilitates communication between government and its policies and those people who are impacted by those policies. Many of those who write for the public are working to make a difference in the world. The course will explore the ethics of writing for the public, the impact of rhetorical contexts on writing, and how writing and revision can allow you to understand a problem or issue in a new way. We'll use examples of public writing, theoretical articles, and the work of students in the class to inform our discussion. Students can expect to write proposals  press kits  editorials  informational Web sites  articles  and complex documents that incorporate photos and other visual elements, sidebars, and feature articles. Since we will see writing as part of a conversation with a larger world, students will report on an event they attend, interview a professional in a field that interests them, and identify and regularly read on or more sources of information: professional journals, media outlets, research studies, or other materials. Note: Students may elect to pursue a service learning project for extra credit. Instructor will provide details during the first class.

The essay is a wonderfully open form, and we’ll explore all manner of approaches: portrait, list, meditation, argument, poem, and complaint. Students will read essays and draw on their own knowledge and experiences, as well as conduct research into subjects of interest, to write.

    Kidd, Katherine

         This course explores the emerging field of working-class literature in the United States.  It is based on the assumption that "class" is an important category not only for literary and cultural studies but also for understanding the ways we live, work, struggle and communicate in the world's "richest" nation.  We will study key texts and moments in a history of writing and cultural production by workers--of every collar:  blue, white, pink, collarless--that stretches over two hundred years, from slave plantations to internet sweatshops.  We will address such questions as:  What is "class," and how does it shape us?  What does it have to do with "work," with the ways we make a living, or fail to?  What are the uses and understandings of "literature" in working-class culture and in our own education?  Texts for the course represent a wide range of forms and purposes, including fiction, poetry, song, autobiography, journalism, film, video, history and cultural theory.

         This is a condensed version of the first two courses of the Spanish language program, and it has been designed for students who have taken at least two years of high school Spanish or its equivalent.  Spanish 0015 follows a communicative approach: from the first day of class you will interact in Spanish in a meaningful context with your instructor and classmates.  By the end of this course you will have a general knowledge of the grammar of the Spanish language and you will be able to communicate effectively in Spanish according to this level.  This course satisfies the foreign language requirement.

         Undergraduate Seminar. The past is pervasive.  We all encounter archaeology in pop culture – movies (“Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”), reality shows (“American Unearthed”), and on eBay.  The past is also powerful. For some people, archaeological materials are museum pieces.  Or treasure.  But for others, archaeological materials may represent identity, be relics of faith, or useful in justifying modern social inequality.  This seminar will explore the differences between professional and “cult” or fantastic archaeology in terms of investigating and knowing the past, and the goals in doing so. We will critically evaluate concepts of scientific evidence, fieldwork, and interpretation inside and outside of contemporary archaeology.  Key themes will include (1) the purposes to which people put the past  (2) controversies over cultural heritage and ancestral claims  (3) alternatives to academic archaeology  and (4) current ethical issues surrounding archaeological remains. These themes will be illuminated through such topics as: ancient astronauts, Atlantis, the Piltdown Man (and more recent frauds) fringe and racial archaeology, looting and museums, and Saddam Hussein using Iraq’s archaeological past to justify military aggression.

         This class seeks to understand the causes, processes, and consequences of long-term Maya political, cultural, and economic resistance and accommodation with reference to non-Maya outsiders. Resistance and accommodation vs. non-Maya outsiders is also related to conflicts within and among Maya communities. To maximize the potential for better understanding through synchronic and diachronic comparisons, these issues are explored with reference to a number of cases arrayed across roughly two millennia of Maya history and prehistory, covering the following periods: modern (1940 to now); republican (AD 1820-1940); colonial (AD 1520-1820); and prehispanic (AD 1-1520). Noteworthy cases to be studied include the current Guatemalan Maya cultural renaissance, the late 20th century Guatemalan state’s war against its Maya populations, an ongoing Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mayas and an indigenizing Mexican revolution and state, ongoing Maya diaspora, Revolt of the Hanged during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), Yucatec Mayas and archaeologists between World Wars I and II, Chamula Caste War (1867-1870), Yucatec Caste War (1847-1901), Totonicapan revolt (1820), Canek revolt (1761), Cancuc revolt (1708-1713), Spanish conquest (1518-1540), and elite-level exotic identity politics relative to Classic (1-1000) and Postclassic (AD 1000-1500) state formations and collapses. A variety of anthropological research methods are used. For the modern Maya the emphasis is on ethnography, for the colonial/republican Maya ethnohistory predominates, and for the prehispanic Maya the focus is on archaeology and epigraphy. To make sense of the diverse cases of conflict and accommodation, we draw on anthropological thinking about such phenomena as violent peasant rebellions, everyday resistance, ethnic nationalism, cultural essentialism, invented traditions, testimonial history, cultural renaissance (or revitalization) movements, gender and authenticity, religious conversion (& syncretism), ethnic tradition as imposed trap or chosen defense mechanism, uses of material culture for communication, and literacy.

         This course explores the latest developments in contemporary art in the context of changes in world visual cultures since the 1960s. The first weeks will concentrate on the transformations of artistic practice that occurred initially in Pop Art, and on the Minimal-Conceptual shift in Western art. This will be followed by a survey of the diversification of artistic practice in the 1980s and 1990s, including the emergence of new internationalisms reflecting postcoloniality, global Contemporary Art, Indigenous art and digital media. The course will conclude with a consideration of the multiplicity of kinds of art that exist today. Visits to local museums and galleries are a vital part of the course.

         From the late eighteenth century, new processes and cultural phenomena that may be globally described as effects of modernization have impinged on architectural design and urban planning throughout the world. The development of new technologies and materials, of colonial expansion and extensive state planning in the 19th century, of multi-national corporations and sprawling urban centers in the 20th century, continue to reshape societies and environments. Through case studies of texts, monuments and sites, this course will investigate the consequences of these trends on architectural design and thought from 1800 to the 20th century.

Through a series of units dealing with different architectural issues and building types (Representation  Landscape  Dwelling  Commerce and Industry  Public Institutions  Sacred Spaces), students will be introduced to ideas and problems that affect the way in which the built environment has been and continues to be shaped in a variety of historical and cultural contexts. We will think broadly about how the spaces that people move through and inhabit in their daily lives shape and are shaped by human behavior, cultural identity, political experience, and the currents of historical circumstance. Contemporary buildings and projects will figure prominently as examples of how designers currently approach architectural, structural and urban problems. Local sites will serve as case-studies for the analysis of different aspects of the built environment. This class is taught in a seminar format with students evaluated on their class participation and assigned projects. Readings and projects will introduce students to a variety of techniques for analyzing and representing the built environment, providing the basic tools for subsequent architectural research and studies.

         As the introductory design studio in the Architectural Studies Design Track, this course explores fundamental design concepts that are essential in the process of creating architecture.   Through a series of interrelated projects, students will be introduced to the primary modes of architectural communication i.e. writing, photography, sketching, diagramming, drafting and model making.  Understanding these devices not only as tools for presentation but as means of exploration, students will work through  conceptual exercises that investigate both qualitative and quantitative characteristics that define the Atmosphere of architectural space.  This design studio will challenge students to develop an understanding of architecture as a procedural practice where the design solution is not a preconceived notion, but evolves through exploration and experimentation.

          Biodegradable metals have emerged as a new class of materials with significant potential for myriad biological applications, in particular, the craniofacial, orthopedics and cardiovascular areas.  The latter has already witnessed clinical trials with few patients already being implanted with a biodegradable metallic stent.  This course is designed to introduce the principles and various fundamental concepts of this novel class of metallic alloys.  These include fundamental principles of metal alloy physics and theory, important concepts of phase diagrams, physical metallurgy concepts, metallic glass theory, processing fundamentals, biocompatibility, and toxicity issues.  The effect of microstructure on biocompatibility and corrosion will also be discussed.  The course objective is to introduce the student to this new family of bio-functional metals and their biodegradable properties.  In doing so, the student will be familiar with these materials and their useful applications.  The students are expected to have had courses in thermodynamics and physiology.

         The goals of the course are to introduce students to historically influential empires of the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean world: Akkad, Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Athens, and Rome. Rather than history as it is reconstructed from texts, this survey will emphasize the comparative cultural profiles of these empires as they are known from the archaeological record: the king, emperor, and in the case of Athens, the Demos, and their constituencies (elites, military, gods), the resources required to control these constituencies (essential commodities, luxuries, an expanded workforce), the visual themes and monument types that were chosen to advertise the success and promote the continuity of the regime beyond the lifetime of its founder, the use of regional themes to establish continuity with the historical past, and the cultural impact of empires on those who belonged to them and those who did not. Monument types will include: palaces and tombs, temples and booty as thank-offering for the acquisition of resources, ‘collections’ as illustrative of the regimes’ control over history and geography (i.e. gardens, zoos, museums, libraries, gifts from other monarchs), administrative buildings and institutions (law codes and their presentation).

    Helbig,Adriana Nadia

         This seminar is designed to explore the ways in which the concept of culture has emerged as a focal point for interdisciplinary scholarship in ethnomusicology in both the humanities and the social sciences.  We will explore the ways in which contemporary scholars study culture as social practice, the social relations of knowledge, and the roles of symbolic, subjective, and expressive practices in constituting as well as reflecting social relations.  At the same time, we will examine the ways in which contemporary scholars connect cultural texts to social and historical contexts, trace the orgins and evolution of cultural practices as social forces, and relate the aesthetic properties and the uses and effects of culture to social structures.  Finally, we will address global displacements of social relations in the present era to examine how they affect the past,present, and future of ethnomusicological scholarship.

          This course combines the ideas from both pure and multicomponent thermodynamics.  It introduces molecular insight and the tools (including commercial software) for solving both simple and complex problems in phase and chemical equilibria.  The course will have a strong focus on multiscale analysis, for example, covering intermolecular potentials (molecular-scale) to aid students in choosing equations of state for novel materials (macro-scale).  Advanced topics covered include interfacial behavior, adsorption, and osmotic equilibrium.

         Like other Seminars in Composition, this introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. This particular seminar will include a series of films, along with discussions that focus on how film and other media shape the ways we view and understand the world. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, the course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing and film.

         In this course students will prepare and deliver public speeches at an advanced skills level and will examine and practice professional speech writing strategies. The teaching style will utilize the intensively interactive methods of workshop learning with the constructive criticism of both the instructor and classmates. In addition to a number of ungraded practice exercises, students will write and deliver four formal, graded speeches chosen from the following categories: Speech of Introduction, Persuasive Policy Speech, Commemorative Values Speech, Speech of Explanation (Apologia), Public Relations Crisis Position Speech, Point-Counterpoint Pairs Speech, Graduation Commencement Speech, and a Self-Designed Category. One speech will require use and command of a modern audio-visual technology (i.e., PowerPoint, Open Internet Connection). We will discuss and practice advanced speaking strategies, tactics and performance skills. Teaching methods will include (1) extensive speaking performance, (2) intensive individualized student and instructor critiques, (3) learning other speaking genres in addition to the informative, persuasive, and ceremonial (i.e., impromptu, point-counterpoint), (4) learning the practical deliberative functions of civil public discourse, (5) learning additional theory, especially theoretical concepts emphasizing style, (6) intensive study of exemplary models, both professional and student-generated, and (7) extensive self-analysis through submission of weekly journals reflecting on personal strengths and weaknesses. The course will prepare students for those oral communication opportunities that cannot be completely predicted, prepared, or written out in advance, especially occasions of impromptu and extemporaneous public speaking. It would concentrate on teaching theoretical concepts which have constructive application in practice and on speaking situations that students are most likely to encounter after graduation. It would highlight creativity, style, and delivery skills from a deliberative, liberal arts perspective combined with intensive practice, direct feedback and realistic simulations.

         As a continuation of French 3, this 3-hour course builds on the linguistic and sociolinguistic skills acquired in French 3.  The focus is on communication and instruction is entirely in the target language.  Course objectives for French 4 are as follows: 1) speak French well enough to ask and answer questions in various situations beyond what is needed to simply "get along" in a francophone culture, i.e., the ability to talk about self and surroundings with a bit of detail  2) understand enough spoken French to grasp main ideas and some supporting details in short conversations related to topics above  3) read well enough to understand principal themes and most details in simple literary and non-literary texts  4) write longer and more cohesive paragraphs  5) cultivate a deeper understanding of French-speaking cultures  6) gain a better understanding of how French works as a language.

         Antiquarianism can be defined as the study of the material remains of the past. In this course, we will consider antiquarianism as it relates to the history of art and architecture in two primary ways. First, we will trace the history of European antiquarianism and its connections to the development and current practices of art history. Second, we will explore the ways in which artists, architects, and other image-makers responded to the old things that the antiquarians studied. Because engagements with the material traces of the past are not a European prerogative, we will also examine the “antiquarian” practices of ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Rome, and China, and we will evaluate artistic responses to antiquities in these places. The course also considers the study and collecting of the past as a component of national identity and modern art and architecture in Iraq, Egypt, Italy, and China. In addition to work in the classroom, we will conduct museum and library visits to examine primary written and visual sources. As a capstone course for the History of Art and Architecture major, students in this course will produce a significant research paper that ties their own research interests to the themes of the course, and they will serve as peer reviewers. They will also develop their oral communication skills through in-class presentations and discussions.

    Wigginton, Rebecca

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

         This course is designed to develop the students' awareness of the actor's process and to foster a general sense of theatre as an area of human endeavor. Students will be introduced to basic communication skills, including physical and vocal presence in front of an audience. The course will also develop an introductory level of acting skill through the use of regular warm-ups, theater games, improvisation, and simple scene study. The class will culminate in the performance of a final scene. Scenes will be selected from a diverse range of playwrights and students will examine the political, cultural and social context of each play. The course will also provide an introduction to basic theater terminology, and foster the ability to respond to and reflect on theatrical performances.

         This "W" course is an introduction to the theoretical treatment of the real numbers, sets, functions, sequences, and limits. Classwork and homework will concentrate on the writing and understanding of proofs of theorems centered on these topics. For most students, the techniques of reading and doing proofs will be new. Two recitations per week, therefore, are required to practice this skill as well as to rehearse the many definitions of mathematical concepts in the course. It is required for all Mathematics and Statistics majors except for Departmental Honors majors who may wish to accelerate by substituting Mathematics 0450 for 0413 and 0420, and then taking Advanced Calculus. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

         This is a condensed version of the first two courses of the Spanish language program, and it has been designed for students who have taken at least two years of high school Spanish or its equivalent.  Spanish 0015 follows a communicative approach: from the first day of class you will interact in Spanish in a meaningful context with your instructor and classmates.  By the end of this course you will have a general knowledge of the grammar of the Spanish language and you will be able to communicate effectively in Spanish according to this level.  This course satisfies the foreign language requirement.

         This course will guide students through a common experimental approach that is used in academic and industry research labs.  In the first part of the semester, students will clone genes that have been selected because they are new genes of interest to research labs within the department.  In the second part of the semester, students will express their cloned genes and purify the encoded proteins.  They will use computer analysis to predict possible functions of their proteins and then test their hypotheses using biochemical techniques.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.

Major assignments include a set of career materials (resume, cover letter, career report); a correspondence packet that addresses a conflict  a proposal  and a longer report based on research and analysis. As we engage in this work we will explore the nature of professionalism, common features and efforts (enabling and disabling) of professional discourse, and strategies for negotiating the "borders" of specialized and non-specialized discourse.

         The Independent Study option permits students to design courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department writing courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         The modern city is simultaneously many different things. It is an assortment of neighborhoods, it is a workshop with factories and offices, it is a crisscross of transportation arteries, it is a marketplace for the interplay of economic interests, it is an object which several different governments try to understand and control, and it is an astonishing mixture of religious, racial, ethnic, recreational, avocational, professional, educational, medical, political, social, and deviant communities.  This urban complex will be studied with a sociological approach.

         This course draws on the multidisciplinary training you have acquired in your pursuit of the Certificate in Russian and East European Studies. Its goal is to build upon your learning about Eurasia to further develop your knowledge, as well as your analytical and communication tools, by studying methods and problems of managing larger projects. Through common readings, discussion, and drafting, you will further your understanding of major problems in Russian, East European, and Eurasian studies, while improving your skills in academic and other professional research, report writing, and presentation. The coursework is organized around your ultimate objective: to produce an advanced-level paper based on original research—a capstone for your work towards the REES Certificate. To achieve these goals, the course emphasizes student discussion of course topics, assigned reading, and work in-progress. Occasionally, the instructor will lecture to introduce topics, themes, and problems.

         This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the core feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality.  In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach “theory” as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the practices that shape our everyday lives, rather than merely a collection of texts. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete organized written analyses that build on feminists who have come before us.

         Even before the United States became a nation, authors began writing our collective history, shaping our national memory.  The stories we have told ourselves about the origins of the nation and its literature have been of key importance to the ways we understand our culture, landscape, and identity.  Yet, our "origin stories" are often complex - rife with invention, revision, distortion, and omission.  In this class, we will focus on specific instances of cultural meaning-making (or "traditions") in American literature.  Along the way, we will consider larger questions about the relationship between history, fiction, and experience.

         This course is a survey of Roman history from the founding of the city in the 8th century B.C.E. to the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century C.E. The history of Rome is the story of how a city-state first unified the Italian peninsula under its military and political leadership  how it then developed into a Mediterranean Empire which, at its greatest territorial extent, stretched from Britain in the West to the Tigris and Euphrates in the East  and how it finally lost political and military control of its empire which broke apart into what became the states of Medieval Europe. As we read a modern narrative history of Rome and the works of Roman and Greek historians, we will examine how Rome acquired and governed its empire  under what forms of government and under whose leadership the affairs of the Roman People were administered  and what causes led to the breakup of the Roman Empire.

         This course fulfills an advanced elective requirement for undergraduate majors. You will learn strategies for giving presentations about science to both a scientific audience and a public audience. Topics covered will include (1) how to engage your audience (2) the art of breaking down your message (3) tips for how to make clear, interesting slides, and (4) pointers on presentation style. All audiences want to learn interesting new scientific information and have it delivered as a good story in an understandable manner by a personable, easy to approach person. You want to emphasize your message, stay focused, and convey the importance of your message while being interesting, maintaining the attention of the audience and making the learning process enjoyable. Guest speakers will provide background information about various uses of scientific information in the public domain. Communication skills, including knowing your audience and why they are interested in the information you are speaking about, how to translate scientific jargon into understandable concepts for the public, and how to keep the audience engaged will be discussed.

         This course addresses the extraordinary variety of ways that animals communicate with each other.  We explore how animals produce and receive signals using sound, light, chemicals, mechanical pressure, and electricity.  We then approach how such signals evolve by considering questions of optimality, decision making, information theory, and economics.  We discuss the contexts in which signals are used, including aggression and dominance, mate attraction and courtship, cooperation and social signaling, and foraging.  We conclude by extending to humans, plants, and microbes.

         Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them  and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

         What is Italy and why does it hold such strong appeal? Whether we imagine it or visit it  claim its heritage or possess it through food or fashion, few other cultures have commanded the attention and affection that Italy does. This class explores the complexity of Italian culture through its history of innovation, ingenuity, and singularity through the ages. Through the study of five interrelated thematic modules—travel  science and technology  beauty and fashion  humanity and power  and performance—students in this course will come to understand the unique contributions Italian culture has made to the world, will learn about the iconic figures who made those contributions, and will better appreciate the complexity of Italian identity, Italian style, and Italian genius. This course satisfies the International Foreign Culture General Education Requirement, and counts for the Italian minor and majors.

Religion & Cultur In East Asia

    Delgado Creamer,Margarita Angelica

         As East Asia becomes more and more central to the world's modern commodity culture, some have predicted a decline in traditional religious values and practices. In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China to Korea and Japan, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased "investment" in religion. This course presents a thematic survey of popular religion in contemporary East Asia, informed by religious, cultural, and political history, and takes a look at how religion participates in shaping the respective worldviews, behaviors, and practices of modern East Asian societies. It further reviews the various responses to the dilemma of self-identity and self-representation suggested by the changing role religion sees for itself in contemporary East Asia and explores the relationship between religion and politics, class, and gender. The course treats the changes we see within East Asian cultures not so much as breaks with tradition but as responses to older themes and behaviors that have been reinterpreted to make themselves relevant to the needs of modern society. We approach this course through lectures, discussions, readings, and films.

         Words have consequences. How a society defines “religion” and “culture” have much to say about how they balance individual freedom and collective responsibility. This course focuses on how religion has been and is practiced in East Asia in modern and contemporary times. We begin with an overview of the major religions in the region (e.g., Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, Shintō, folk traditions), and examine various themes to help us learn how religion influences the lives of individuals and the wider societies in which they live. Themes dealt with include the relationship between religion and politics, nationalism, terrorism, secularization, gender and the family, the life cycle and ritual calendar year, healing, ethical behavior, and the environment. By looking at how these issues unfold in modern China and Japan and at their global significance enable us to better understand how religion shapes our world.

         This course explores the history and development of the people of Israel in ancient times. What do we know about the Israelites and how do we know it? Students will read both biblical and extra-biblical materials and study the remains of key archaeological sites. They will learn about everyday life in ancient Israel, the role of class and gender, life-cycle events, religious festivals, political institutions, systems of belief, and famous personages in history and lore. The trajectory of the course will begin with the Near Eastern origins of the people, continue through the rise of the Israelite and Judahite monarchies, and end with the post-exilic reestablishment of the Second Temple commonwealth in the Persian period.

         This course explores histories, cultures, and socio-political issues of relevance to women of African descent across the geographical spectrum of the Pan-African world: Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America, and North America.  The course begins by exploring gender and sex, and then delves into ideas of feminism, black feminism, and womanism as relevant ideologies for women of African descent.  Finally, the course uses articles and three major texts---a novel (Zimbabwe) and two ethnographies (United States and Brazil), to examine issues of colonialism, identity politics, colorism, cultural representation, sex work, and women in hip hop.

         In this section of Seminar in Composition, we will explore reading and writing by considering the interrelationship of college education and the community life of Pittsburgh. Students in this section will engage in service-learning, pairing meaningful service in the community with the academic work for the course. Throughout the term, the students will provide service with community organizations of their choice  students can expect to devote about 2-3 hours a week, for a total of thirty hours of service over the course of the term. Our discussions will focus on their experiences during this service work as well as their reflections on this experience as guided by a sequence of critical readings and short essay assignments. We will be working every week to read and discuss the essays that the students produce for this course. By considering these subjects in this community context, our goal will be to improve the essay-writing skills students bring to this course by helping them to become more critical readers and writers.

         Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic units (households, managers, firms) make their choices from the alternatives available to them  and how such choices interact in the market to determine prices and allocate resources. We attempt to understand economic activity and analyze the effects of policy by constructing what we think are reasonable representations of how these units behave when confronted with economic decisions. This course is an introduction to the basic notions of microeconomics. It will focus on developing (somewhat theoretical / mathematical) models to analyze economic decision-making and to apply them to real world situations. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of a microeconomist and prepare them to take more advanced economics courses like Labor, Industrial Organization, International Trade and Public Finance.

         This course examines Slavic and anglophone science fiction comparatively. It assesses how a given culture's dominant values are articulated in a popular genre that enjoys different status in the East (i.e., Eastern Europe) and the West (i.e., England and America). Those values emerge in works that imaginatively posit "fantastic" situations rooted in biological, spatial, and temporal explorations beyond those currently verified by science. On the basis of films (e.g., "The Terminator", "The Fly"), film clips, TV shows, novels (e.g., "Solaris", "The Futurological Congress"), novellas, and stories, we shall discuss such topics as progress, utopia, human perfectibility, the limits of science, and the nature of knowledge.

         Transformations in the status, appearance, and meaning of artworks during the European Renaissance have profoundly affected Western visual culture. This course explores the extraordinary experiments of competitive, innovative artists and patrons, going beyond stylistic change to focus on the role of artistic invention in shaping Renaissance society. It considers the shifting functions of the visual arts in Europe between 1250 and 1600. Artists to be discussed include Giotto, Brunelleschi, Donatello, van Eyck, Botticelli, Mantegna, Leonardo, Durer, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian. Students will be asked to write short papers on thematic issues throughout the term and, at the end of the semester, they will undertake a more substantial project that engages the research methods of art history.

         Through museum visits in Florence and Rome students will realize that most of the artworks actually displayed in public museums once belonged to private collectors and were not produced to be seen by a large public. During the course students will explore the history of collecting objects. They will start with the sacred collections of Classical temples, passing then to the libraries of Medieval monasteries and the ideas of the Abbot Suger. They will imagine recreating a Medieval Schatzkammer and an Early Renaissance Studiolo thanks to the remaining precious vases that belonged to Lorenzo the Magnificent and the documents of the Urbino Palace and Isa-bella d’Este Studiolo. They will ‘virtually’ visit the Paolo Giovio collection, and the real Studiolo of Francesco I as well as 16th and 17th century Baroque Galleries. They will follow the growth of European National Museums of the nineteenth century (Louvre, British, Muse-ums Island in Berlin) as symbols of national pride as well as the Florentine private collections transformed in foundations like the Bardini and Horne Museums. An in depth study will be done on the Uffizi Gallery in order to understand the transformation of the gallery from the late 16th century to the present day. Finally they will face the role of museums in the contemporary world making a personal research on Florence main museums’ visitors.

         This is a course in Galois Theory, which is one of the most prominent mathematical achievements of all time. It is a theory with deep and rich ramifications, leading, for example, to the resolution of millennia old questions on the impossibility of some straightedge and compass constructions. Highlights of the course will include: the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, the fundamental theorem of algebra, the theorem of the primitive element, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, straightedge and compass constructions, Galois groups and solvability by radicals of cubic and quartic equations.

         Painting 0120 is an introduction to techniques of oil painting and diverse subject matter for compositional development and creative expression. Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting 0120. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit from the University of Pittsburgh Bookstore. Painting 0120 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work and in regard to the departmentâ€™s policy on attendance. There is a $15.00 lab fee.

         Foundation Drawing is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing 0130 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work and in regard to the departments policy on attendance. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is one that the student has worked with before and is comfortable with the subject matter of the study. Specific forms for requesting this faculty approval can be picked up in the Department Advising office, 617B CL. The forms require a description of the project you are proposing, a list of the requirements and readings that you and the faculty sponsor have agreed upon, the signature of the faculty sponsor, and the signature of the department adviser. Please note that a student must have earned at least 6 credits in department writing courses, and that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         German 0003 will provide students with opportunities to strengthen their listening and speaking abilities and mastery of German grammar, to read a variety of short authentic texts as well as a longer adapted book, and to write longer and more complex compositions than those assigned in Elementary German courses. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. Students may also be called on to work with web materials, complete both listening and reading comprehension assignments, and work on a group project. Together with GER 0004, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

         The key to achieving a successful theatrical production is effective communication among all theatre artists during the process of development. Emphasis in this course is placed on collaboration, visualization, research, script interpretation, concept development and performance. Students will be exposed to the work of notable artists in each field and explore theatre making from the vantage point of designers, dramaturgs, playwrights, producers, critics, historians, directors and actors. Over the first two weeks, students will gain a broad base of knowledge regarding the roles and responsibilities inherent in any collaborative theatre process. In the ensuing weeks students will explore a number of contemporary artists and devise their own collaborative projects.  Students will become theatre makers.

          Traditionally, chemical product design has focused on a set procedure for product development from conception to development and testing and finally the launching of the product. Unfortunately, this model which does not keep in mind the values or needs of the customer has resulted in a high number of failures for new product launches. What skills are thus needed in order to be entrepreneurial and succeed in the development of new chemical products within industry today?  This course examines the initial stages on how to approach chemical product design from an innovation perspective complete with the provision of the necessary technical skills to get the job done while placing an emphasis on the business and entrepreneurial skills required to be successful in the chemical product design business.

         Contemporary Global Stages is an introduction to the analysis of global performance in written, aural and live forms across multiple geographies and in relation to diaspora, media and cultural transmission.” Dance Worlds will focus on dance histories on a global scale. We will draw on historical and theoretical frameworks across disciplines to gain deeper understandings of the cultural, social, and political roles of dance around the world. By looking at different dance worlds, we will learn, for example, how aesthetics such as spatial arrangement of couples can define a social hierarchy. The class will also explore how movement styles or aspects of embodiment reflect attitudes toward space, rhythm, the natural world, religion, culture, emotion, etc. During the class, we will also engage physically with the aesthetics of that dance. By engaging physically in addition to our historical and theoretical work, we will be able to gain a different level of understanding and empathy for each of the dance worlds we investigate.

         This course is designed to develop the students' awareness of the actor's process and to foster a general sense of theatre as an area of human endeavor. Students will be introduced to basic communication skills, including physical and vocal presence in front of an audience. The course will also develop an introductory level of acting skill through the use of regular warm-ups, theater games, improvisation, and simple scene study. The class will culminate in the performance of a final scene. Scenes will be selected from a diverse range of playwrights and students will examine the political, cultural and social context of each play. The course will also provide an introduction to basic theater terminology, and foster the ability to respond to and reflect on theatrical performances.

         This introductory course explores performance and seeks to define it as a practice, a theory, and an academic discipline that in each instance remains dynamic and unfinishable. The study of multiple performances, whether they be cultural, social, or aesthetic (theatrical) in nature is a constantly changing, shifting observation of instances of interaction. More importantly the instances of performance we will engage are interdisciplinary and intercultural. To be “Inter”—is to exist between,” or “on the way from something to something else.” We will view, experience, engage with, wonder at and about all types of performance using both existing and emergent lenses of exploration. The final four weeks of the course will consist of workshops, discussions, and group interaction toward the completion of student created projects.

    Kim,Junyoung

         This course will explore the role of violence in contemporary Latin American cinema by examining both film media’s representational capacity and its aesthetic composition or form. Departing from the contention that films not only create narratives, but also produce thought, we will focus on an analysis of Latin American films produced in the last twenty years, to interrogate whether violence can function as an aesthetic, theoretical and/or affective device to rethink the social, the political, and the economic.  Are Latin American films merely faithful representations of the sociopolitical and economic violence that characterizes the Latin American “reality” of today?  Do manifestations of violence in Latin American cinema offer new ways of thinking about and processing sociopolitical and economic conflicts?  Or is violence being commodified and reified as Latin American cultural difference in order to promote and brand Latin American cinema in the global market and circuit of international film festivals?  We will address these questions by exploring the ways in which Latin America cinema is placed in a constitutive and disruptive relationship to the violent forces of the neoliberal state and globalization.  These inquiries will be made in three inter-related ways. First, we will study several Latin American films from various nations and productions that include Victor Gaviria’s La vendedora de rosas (1998), Alejandro González Iñarritú’s Amores perros (2000), Héctor Babenco’s Carandiru (2003), Claudia Llosa’s La teta asustada (2009), Pablo Larraín’s Post mortem (2010), Amat Escalante’s Heli (2013), and Damián Szifron’s Relatos salvajes (2014). Second, we will look at specific events and cases of violence with which these films engage, such as gender, racial and class oppression, military dictatorships and the police state, drug trafficking and neoliberal restructuring.  Lastly, we will read critical texts by various key authors on theories of violence, film studies, and Latin American cultural studies, such as Rey Chow, Ella Shohat, Jason Mohaghegh, Jean Franco, and Ileana Rodríguez.

         This course is intended to expose students to issues regarding the social and ethical implications of technology. In recent years, many computer professionals have become increasingly aware of the societal impacts of the increased use of computer technology in everyday life. While technology promises many benefits to our society and economy, there are also well founded concerns that serious problems may arise. This course is intended to introduce students to the main issues surrounding the computerization of society, and to help students understand the development, application, and consequences of information technology as social as well as technical processes. Topics include computerization and the quality of work life, unemployment, personal privacy and freedom of information, ownership and rights to software, and the manageability, risks and accountability of complex systems. The course seeks to foster in students a critical approach to the understanding of the impact of technology in society via the academic skills of reading, writing and argumentation. The course is designed to meet the program WRIT requirement for CS majors.

         This course is a thematic survey of Latin American history from the early nineteenth-century wars of independence to the present. We will first explore the broad social, economic, and political processes that shaped the formation of Latin American nations in the nineteenth century. Focusing on specific countries, we will then consider the diverse political paths that Latin Americans have taken in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and the varied ways they have envisioned democracy, social justice, and economic development. Lectures and readings will consider a range of countries including Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Bolivia, and Chile. Course materials include manifestos, speeches, human rights reports, a few film clips, and the news.

         The objective of this course is to provide students with an appreciation of the place of political theory in political science more generally. It will begin with readings about the relationship between normative theory and empirical research. We will then turn our attention to classics in political theory such as Machiavelli, Hobbes, Mill, and Marx. The last section of the course will focus on contemporary (20th and 21st century) political theory, with emphasis on issue-based theories that respond to specific challenges in contemporary governance such as cultural diversity, democratic participation, state legitimacy, and the nature of political power.

         This upper level lab course presents a social-psychological research orientation toward the study of human sexual behavior, with a major emphasis on the ways in which research is conducted in this area. A secondary theme is the interaction of social and biological factors in determining sexual behavior. Topics that will be addressed include sex hormones and sexual arousal, sexual orientation, the menstrual cycle, and pregnancy and childbirth. Other topics include contraception, love and attraction, sexually transmitted diseases and coercive sexual behavior. In this course students engage in classroom activities, small group discussions and have opportunity to talk to invited guests. This course will also require an in-depth look at understanding how to conduct research in topics related to sexuality. Requirements involve small research projects in which students read literature, develop hypothesis regarding aspects of sexuality and design experiments to test these theories and write-up the experiments, exams and short papers.

         Audre Lorde’s bold claim that “poetry is not a luxury” places artistic expression as essential to the hard work of social justice. This course looks at how narrative functions as a vital component to social movements from the 1960s until today. We will examine texts vital to their larger social movements, including but not limited to Alex Haley’s The Autobiography of Malcolm X, George Jackson’s Soledad Brother, Gloria Anzaldúa’s Borderlands/La Frontera, Sherman Alexie’s Reservation Blues, Roxane Gay’s Bad Feminist, the anthology This Bridge Called My Back by the “radical women of color,” Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, and Ta’Nehisi Coates Between the World and Me. In addition to literature and poetry—such as the writings of Audre Lorde, Angela Davis, Adrienne Rich, and Suheir Hammad—we will look at alternative forms of communication: performances (such as El Teatro Campesino and the performance art of Coco Fusco), music (jazz/John Cage/Beyoncé), and film (such as Pa’lante, The Battle of Algiers, and Jose Antonio Vargas’ Documented). As we dive into the controversial arena of protest literature, we will question the relationship between art and politics, between aesthetics and social change. Do these narratives define their respective movements? Or do they challenge us to think differently about them? This course provides the framework from which you can develop your own research project based on a movement of your choice and the artistic expression that has played an integral role within it.

         This writing-intensive section of Imagining Social Justice focuses on the evolution of dystopian literature. Students will define the characteristics, history and purpose of dystopian lit by examining examples of the narrative type written during the Twentieth century. The student will then compare the historical characteristics and purpose with those of dystopian literature written after the tragedy of 9/11. The course will end by extrapolating the future trajectory of the narrative type. As a writing intensive section, the course will require the student to practice significant levels of writing and revision, as well as basic competency in higher order argumentation skills.

         Not poetry and not drama, "prose" has come to signify any writing that speaks in ordinary language, whether to tell a story or argue an idea. But within this broad category we find a rich variety of lengths, shapes, sizes, and styles, which lay claim to a wide range of degrees of "truthfulness"-from the supposedly factual scientific article or personal account to the fantastic and surreal in fiction. This section examines the difference between "fiction" and "non-fiction," as well as between different forms of fiction, by examining borderline cases: we will read novels which border on various forms of non-fiction, as well as hybrid texts which are ambiguously novels and short story collections.

         This Undergraduate Seminar examines theories and case studies from the field of ethnoarchaeology which lies at an intersection of social anthropology and archaeology. Ethnoarchaeologists study people and their record of material culture in the ethnographic present, with an archaeological interest in how past people might have produced their own material culture records (ranging widely from fetid rubbish to exquisite artworks). Ethnoarchaeology thereby provides useful information for building analogical models needed to infer past thoughts and behaviors from material remains in the archaeological record. Equally interesting and useful are the fresh and timely understandings which ethnoarchaeology offers about how recent people interact with their material world. With the focus on materiality in past and present, the seminar can engage the interest of archaeologists, social anthropologists, historians, art historians, sociologists, and other social scientists.

         Undergraduate Seminar. This course will engage with anthropology not only as an academic discipline but also as a tool and ‘application’ that lends itself to evaluating various international aid programs, interventions, criticisms and collaborations.  Therefore, major attention will be paid to understanding and analyzing how international aid programs and economic development policies operate “on the ground”. Development topics such as food security, water, education, gender equality, and human rights will be examined in a critical and ethnographic manner.  Other themes under investigation include ‘indigenous’ knowledge, poverty, forms of freedom, social capital, markets, institutions, civil society, governance, and the discourse of progress.

         This course discusses the physics of mechanical systems as it was understood at the end of the 19th century.  The emphasis of the course will be on the work of Isaac Newton, Joseph Louis Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton.  The mathematics required in our discussions and in solving mechanical problems will require that the student have a basic knowledge of trigonometry, calculus and introductory physics.  The more advanced mathematics to be employed in this course will also prove to be useful in other physics courses and fields other than physics.  The course will conclude with a brief overview of special relativity, the work of Albert Einstein, which was introduced early in the 20th century.

         This course is intended for students involved in the production of an honor’s thesis (or an alternative honor’s project) in the Department of History of Art and Architecture.  It will function as a lab and complement the individual work you are doing with your advisor on your thesis or project by immersing you in a collaborative work environment.  You and your peers will tackle common problems, review each other’s efforts, and give constructive criticism and suggestions.  The primary goal of the course centers on the thesis project itself.   The idea is to create an intellectual community that will help you produce a better project than you would in isolation.  A second goal of our intellectual community is to help you present your work effectively in the department’s showcase event, HAAARCH!, and outside the department as well.  Toward the end of the semester we will experiment with mock interviews to prepare you to discuss your project, and your educational training at Pitt, in a very concise and engaging way with professionals from other contexts.  Class meetings will be working sessions structured around homework exercises, oral presentations, and reviews of student work.

         Sport captures the minds and money of billions of people everyday, the Olympics, World Cup Soccer, American College Football, and Little League World Series. Television, radio, cell phones, internet keep us updated on the latest scores, highlights and goings on of our favorite and least favorite athletic personalities. Yet despite its overwhelming significance in everyday life it goes largely ignored in Anthropological discussions. This course serves to introduce students to the significance and centrality of sport in understanding and interpreting social life. Sport will be critically examined through major anthropological categories of race, class, ethnicity, gender and power. We will be using sport as the focal point with which to examine varying attitudes, institutions and social dynamics. We will examine such topics as biological racism, masculinity, women in sports, gay and transgender issues in sport, sport and economics as well as sport and its connection to citizenship. This will not be a history of sport nor will it be a cross-cultural comparison of different kinds of sport from around the world but rather this course will seek to demonstrate to you how sport figures into the shaping of our worldview and structuring of social institutions.

         The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

         This course will consider some of the most important lines of thought in Western intellectual history, from the Ancient Greeks to the Scientific Revolution. We will begin briefly with ancient Greek speculations in cosmology, natural philosophy, and medicine. Then we will examine how they develop through the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. These include, among other topics, the magical, alchemical, and astrological traditions that flourished from Antiquity through the 17th century. In the second half of the course will focus on the exciting intellectual transformations in 17th-century Britain and Europe, which constitute the beginnings of modern science. The great scientific achievements of figures such as Galileo, Kepler, Copernicus, Descartes, Boyle, and Newton will be discussed. In this course, students will gain a clear understanding of the multi-dimensional origins of modern science.

These include, among other topics, the magical tradition that flourished during the Renaissance period. The latter half of the course will focus on the profound intellectual transformations in the 17th century which constitute what we often call The Scientific Revolution. The great scientific achievements of figures such as Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton will be discussed in detail. Overall, this course is meant to provide a broad picture of some of the most important elements in the Western intellectual tradition and their interactions in history.

         The term “existentialism” is used to group together a number of philosophers and novelists who are concerned to understand the idea that an individual human life can be meaningful, to defend that idea against a number of (perceived) threats that stem from the rise of modern science, or to understand the idea of a good individual human life in terms of its meaning. In this course we will survey the history of this movement by studying the works of many of its most important proponents and critics.

         This workshop-style course explores the sentence in its many forms and seeks to deepen students' understanding of grammar as a repertoire of choices for expression.  Grammar and punctuation are often learned as rules by which to write, yet seldom are they embraced as creative forms that offer possibilities for drama, beauty, suspense, satisfaction-to suggest just a few of the aesthetic qualities a shapely sentence might impart. Through the use of imaginative exercises, writing assignments, and discussion of texts written by students, poets, and essayists, we will immerse ourselves in the practice of writing compelling sentences that best express our thoughts and motives.  Or, to put it another way, we will write, punctuate, digress, qualify, equivocate, assert, tease, infer, remedy, revise, borrow (and perhaps "steal") in ways that make our readers give their best attention to our ideas.

         What is worth collecting?  What motivates collectors? Spanning art, archeology and material culture from the ancient world to the present day, this course explores the tensions between private property and public heritage that shape the history of collecting. Subjects will include iconoclasm and the destruction of cultural artefacts, booty and looting in times of war, cabinets of curiosity, private and corporate collectors, deaccessioning, repatriation and the ethics of public collections. Particular attention will be paid to the upheavals of World War II, the aftermath of colonialism and the role of UNESCO in prohibiting the illicit trade in cultural property. Students will encounter historical, anthropological, and art historical approaches to these issues, and gain practical experience with collection management systems and provenance research. This is a core course for the minor in Museum Studies.

         Introduction to the evolutionary history of our species, Homo sapiens, beginning with understanding our place among monkeys and apes, the diversity of our now extinct closest relatives, and, eventually, their – and our – possible evolutionary relationships.  In order to pursue this topic properly we will delve into the areas of comparative anatomy, geology, and paleontology, as well as evolutionary theory, especially the concept of “species” and figuring out evolutionary relationships. Lectures will rely heavily on slides and weekly handouts. There will be three exams.  All will be based on T/F, multiple choice, fill-in, and “identify this structure or specimen” types of questions. The final grade will be based on these exams, (e.27%, 27%, 27%), as well as attendance in lecture and recitations, participation in recitation, and performance on quizzes (19%).

         The course presents Central European filmmaking in its cultural context, and Central European culture through film. While it is structured around Slovak and Czech filmmaking (e.g., early works by the Oscar-winning director of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and one of the most celebrated, dazzling film experiments), the course includes a limited number of Hungarian and Polish films, as well as one acclaimed American film based on a Czech novel for comparison. The students learn to discuss them in their cultural context against the panorama of life in Central Europe, as well as from the American perspective. Among the most frequent comments from anonymous course evaluations have been, "very good communication with students, the class discussions are always a high point," and "I love those films!" You need to be able to watch subtitled films, a few with a higher incidence of nudity, and be open to having your mind shuffled around Central Europe, from Prague to a Gypsy village, from Bratislava, to Budapest, to the valleys of the Carpathians, and back. Most films are shown in their entirety, with discussions and handouts. They can be viewed again individually on monitors in Hillman Library. The course requires the students to write. There are weekly assignments, a midterm paper, and a final paper  no tests or quizzes. You may choose to skip two of the weekly assignments. The focus is both on film aesthetics, and on the social implications of the content of the films, which was considered crucial by Central European directors, screenwriters, and audiences. Anonymous comments have said, "my critical writing skills have improved during the course," and "writing a paper every week stimulated my thoughts and I often considered things I normally wouldn't." Several students have honed their writing skills sufficiently to have some of their class assignments, with additional revisions, accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

In this course, we will examine the origins of the Iroquoians, the effects of European contact, and their later development in the context of a dominant Euro-American culture.  One of the primary aims of the course is for anthropology majors to learn how anthropologists do research. We will work on how to identify research problems, derive hypotheses, and test them in the context of Iroquoian research.  Class discussion of research problems and the readings will be an important component of this course. As this is a writing course, there will be several shorter writing assignments and one longer term paper that will be commented on and revised at least once.

We will read and watch films about social networking, blogging, remix culture, hacking, the Anonymous movement, cyber-surveillance, data mining, creative commons, copyleft, and network production. We will ask how digital media might foster or foreclose possibilities for new forms of work, creative expression, and political mobilization. For instance, we will discuss various forms of hacking as a key terrain where battles over the regulation of the Internet and struggles over intellectual property rights are waged. We will also read about data mining—corporate efforts to gain profit from transforming into data the traces we leave behind in the cyberspace. Further, we will discuss social networking and blogging to understand how digital media facilitate the formation of new communities. We will consider how anthropology might offer fresh insights to studying digital media and how the study of digital media might inspire anthropologists to rethink classic anthropological concepts such culture, community, and self. (Readings will be available on CourseWeb in pdf format.)

         The work of this seminar considers science fiction and its relationship to myth and religion.  Myth here is understood as a body of beliefs that seeks to answer questions about humans and the divine, humans and technology, humans and science.  Through a variety of readings and viewings, we will consider the way science fiction uses myth and religion to complicate our understanding of the past, the present, and the future.

         GER 0004 is intended to follow GER 0003.  Students will continue reading longer and more difficult texts, complete the grammar review begun in GER 003, expand their vocabulary, and write longer and more complex compositions. Class periods consist largely of communicative activities designed to strengthen grammatical knowledge and broaden and deepen students' vocabulary. Students may also be called on to work with web materials, complete both listening and reading comprehension assignments, and work on a group project. Together with GER 003, the course begins transitioning from the development of basic communication skills to more in-depth spoken and written discussions of German-speaking culture.

         This course will provide the student with a solid understanding of macroeconomic theory and ensure that the student can apply macroeconomic analysis to the study of economic problems. The course covers the development of modern macroeconomic theory, including classical, Keynesian, monetarist and new classical views of the macroeconomy. Key areas to be covered include theories of business cycles, employment, inflation, economic growth and macroeconomic policy. Particular attention will be given to the role of money in general and monetary policy in particular. Considerable emphasis will be placed on analysing the strengths and weaknesses of these models and understanding how they differ. Students are required to have successfully completed introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics courses before enrolling on this course. Knowledge of elementary calculus is required.

         This course will engage with anthropology not only as an academic discipline but also as a tool and ‘application’ that lends itself to evaluating various international aid programs, interventions, criticisms and collaborations.  Therefore, major attention will be paid to understanding and analyzing how international aid programs and economic development policies operate “on the ground”. Development topics such as food security, water, education, gender equality, and human rights will be examined in a critical and ethnographic manner.  Other themes under investigation include ‘indigenous’ knowledge, poverty, forms of freedom, social capital, markets, institutions, civil society, governance, and the discourse of progress.

         Blood is an enticing substance. It ties people together, even when it is spilled. Just as blood produces social bonds, it divides people and groups according to notions of family, race, class (think “blue blood”), and nationhood. Blood both sacralizes and pollutes, fascinates and disgusts. Blood can infect  it also makes people swoon. Blood also seems to guarantee instant blockbusters and bestsellers. How can this fluid (mostly water, as we know) do such important social and symbolic work? This course takes blood as a thematic through which students can begin to explore topics that have long been at the core of anthropological investigation: kinship and family (including reproductive technologies and adoption); race and nationhood  ideas of pollution, infection, and contamination (also in contemporary medical practice); and rituals of incorporation and transformation (including, of course, vampires).

         This course explores some of the ways in which anthropology has intersected with psychology.  It begins with a survey of the way anthropologists have borrowed psychological idioms/theories in their research, and then shifts to more recent work in which anthropologists have approached psychologists, and the mental health fields more broadly, as subjects for ethnographic research.  Topics covered include: studies of “culture and personality,” anthropologies of emotion and affect, trans-cultural psychiatry, the political-economy of psychological services, global mental health, and the expansion of pharmaceutical living.

         This course introduces students to the cultural history of the Hispanic World. Starting with the study of Pre-Colombian civilizations and the controversial politics of the Spanish Conquest we will discuss the conflicts involved in the transformation of Latin America. Through a broad variety of texts  chronicles, documentaries, films, fiction and novels, students will learn about the Spanish-speaking world and also explore the complex interactions implied in the process of colonization, in the foundation of national identities and in the creation of cultural traditions. We will stress the importance that these social and political tensions have in order to understand the past but also we will analyze its impact in the present.

         The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to the cultural histories of the Hispanic world, with a particular emphasis on Latin America. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we will study the interaction of social, political, ethnic, racial, and gender dynamics, and the resulting transformations in Latin America, past and present. After a study of pre-contact Iberian and Amerindian societies, we will critically examine the ensuing conflicts that characterized the three centuries of contested colonial rule in Latin America. We will then focus on the different national projects and revolutions that shaped the current geopolitical landscape through both cultural manifestations as well as discourses of national identity and calls for patriotic behavior. We will close with an overview of some of the challenges actors across Latin America face at the turn of the millennium. Throughout the semester, the goal will be both to learn about Latin America and about how it has been thought by its past and present scholars, tracing differences and continuities.

Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

         This course is designed to build foundational acting skills using Stanislavski-based exercises such as those devised by Sanford Meisner, Stella Adler and/or Uta Hagen. These exercises aim to develop the actor’s ability to listen and respond truthfully in the moment, be present and connect, work with spontaneity, build concentration, and incite the imagination. Students will learn to craft behavior by working on contemporary text and engaging in improvisational exercises with partners as well as a series of solo projects. Students will also explore given circumstances and actions/objectives while working on audition techniques with a monologue. Students will then apply textual analysis skills and build rehearsal technique by bringing him/her-self to life in a role in a scene.  This course is a building block and prerequisite for other performance courses in the theatre department. Students interested in the Theater major or minor or who have theatre experience are encouraged to audition into this course (in lieu of Introduction to Performance).

    Majumdar, Neepa

         This seminar will focus on the history and theory of cinema from 1960 to the present.  While individual theorists and historians will be discussed, there will be special attention paid to historical and theoretical debates within film studies. These debates will be explored through major film journals, theorists, filmmakers, and film movements. The focus will be three-fold: (1) formal analysis of film texts in their historical context  (2) the technological and sociocultural history of cinema  and (3) philosophical questions pertaining to cinema and its relation to technology, ideology, perception, and gender, sexual, and racial identities and practices. Each week’s readings will be designed to stimulate discussion in more than one of these three areas.  A graduate seminar is a cooperative effort that depends for its success upon the active participation of its student members. You should be prepared to reflect on the readings and films in your weekly response papers and to contribute your questions, insights, and views to the class. Course material for the final four weeks of the semester will be shaped to the interests of seminar participants.

         In today's marketplace, proposals produce billions of dollars to help solve problems and support causes that people care about. Grant proposals make possible important research in the natural, behavioral, and social sciences  they enable many to benefit from civic and educational projects  and they benefit community development and fund artistic achievement. Other types of proposals allow people to start businesses, create change on the job, and define projects that meet the needs of particular audiences. This course will allow students to understand the functions and conventions of proposals, the types of research that they require, and the processes that generate them and lead to approval. Students will focus on two main issues: developing a proposal (which includes activities such as defining needs, reviewing existing projects and literature, and, if seeking a grant, researching sources of funds) and writing a proposal with a specific audience in mind. Coursework will help students develop an understanding of proposal writing from an initial idea through final submission. Students will complete a variety of written pieces leading up to the final proposal, which may be valuable in their employment portfolios. Upon completion of this course, students will have acquired the research and writing skills necessary to write successful proposals.

         In this course we will examine the contexts for and rhetorical dimensions of a variety of professional documents, including those documents students produce in the course itself. Major assignments include a set of career materials (resume, cover letter, career report); a correspondence packet that addresses a conflict  a proposal  and a longer report based on research and analysis. As we engage in this work we will explore the nature of professionalism, common features and efforts (enabling and disabling) of professional discourse, and strategies for negotiating the "borders" of specialized and non-specialized discourse.

         The Honors recitation is an extension of the Rhetorical Process course, with special emphasis on 1) the formulation of productive questions, 2) deliberate, informed invention, and 3) the conception of student-driven projects that leverage students’ academic expertise and lived experience for the generation of collaborative analyses and solutions to social, political, economic, and cultural problems. Students wishing to take the Honors recitation must be enrolled in COMMRC 0310 as well as one of the regular recitations coordinated by the teaching assistants. Students in the Honors recitation would thus earn a total of 4 credits. Students without the GPA or course prerequisites designated by the University Honors College may also enroll with the permission of the instructor.

         In The New York Times article “A Language for Grieving,” Sonya Posmentier writes, “By making violence strange and unfamiliar, very different poets like [Gwendolyn] Brooks and [M. NourbeSe] Philip have gone beyond merely repeating its effects, like a viral video of a police shooting, and beyond the realm of the evidentiary to that of the imagination, where we might not only observe violence but mourn and counter it.” I read this six months after attending a Cave Canem retreat where Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon emphasized the importance of joy in black life. “Our story is not abjection,” she wrote in a workshop handout. “That’s somebody else’s narrative. … Our anger is not ugly. Our joy is not absurd.”

In the first half of the course the students  will learn methods of sequence analysis and comparative genomics while working with genomes of recently sequenced bacteriophages.  Students will then make hypotheses about which genes are essential for phage growth.  In the second half they will perform a series of experiments to test these hypotheses by generating mutations.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.

    Skoczylas,Marie Bernadette

         This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the core feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality.  In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach “theory” as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the practices that shape our everyday lives, rather than merely a collection of texts. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete organized written analyses that build on feminists who have come before us.

         People often describe the late 1960s and 1970s as years of “sexual revolution.” By this they sometimes refer to the sexual freedom afforded to many men and women in the West by the invention of oral contraception and the emergence of the so-called new social movements: the women’s movement as well as various countercultural movements (hippies, students, peace activists), and the gay and lesbian movements. To be sure, it was not the first time in history that some could enjoy sex with partners of either sex, explore a variety of sexual practices, disconnect sex from reproduction as well as from love or monogamy. But it was certainly the first time that people did so en masse and at a time when there was a political and philosophical discourse available for them to use in order to counter the stigmatization to which their predecessors had been subjected: the libertines of the 1960s and 1970s were no longer sinners or perverts, they were revolutionaries.

The course will demonstrate empirical methods used by syntacticians in arriving at analyses of syntactic phenomena, including, for example, the role of grammaticality judgments and the construction of sentences to test for such things as constituent structure, the properties of subjects and objects, whether a verb is a raising or control verb, and the behavior of reflexive versus non-reflexive pronouns in a language. The course will introduce students to at least one method of formal analysis of linguistic phenomena, one of which will be some version of transformational grammar.

         The independent study option permits students in good academic standing to design Public and Professional Writing (PPW) courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. The independent study must integrate both the theory and practice of some aspect of public and/or professional writing, and the student must conduct research that will allow him or her to contextualize the writing forms and content being studied. Students typically write at least 30 pages (or 7,500 words) over the course of the term, and revision plays a significant role in the student's work. In addition, the student and sponsoring faculty member define a reading list and other required research, which may include interviews or surveys. The student and faculty member will agree on other work, such as essays or documents and a journal or other response to the research. Whenever possible, the student will create a final document that can be used by an intended audience or in a professional portfolio. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is comfortable with the subject matter of the study and has worked with the student in the past. The specific form for requesting this faculty approval can be obtained from the Director or Associate Director of PPW in M-2 Thaw Hall. The form requires a description of the project you are proposing, what you expect to learn from it, the reading and research you will do, the products you will create as a result of your study, and the ways in which your sponsor will engage with your work. You should expect to meet with your sponsor at least eight times during the term. Please note that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         Science and technology are integral to contemporary societies. Understanding how science is produced and how it shapes daily life is a crucial challenge for anthropologists, who have studied the production of scientific knowledge in labs, hospitals, field sites, and elsewhere. While early studies of science as a cultural practice focused primarily on the U.S. and Europe, science and technology are produced and consumed globally. Through analyses of case studies of biotechnology, medicine, genetics, conservation, agriculture, energy, climate science, and computing around the world, this class will investigate the global dynamics of science and technology. Juxtaposing readings on different scientific fields from around the globe, we will look for recurring themes that connect these studies. What happens when science and technology travel, and how do new places emerge as centers of knowledge production? How are culture, identity, technology, and science linked?

         Semiotic anthropology examines the social life of meaning. It extends questions of representation and interpretation beyond the study of language to examine how culture orders and is ordered by the objects that surround us. Drawing on recent work in anthropology, philosophy, and industrial design this course investigates four interrelated questions: How are value and meaning assigned to objects? How does culture shape sensory perception? How are styles defined, interpreted and changed over time? How do landscapes, infrastructure, and architecture shape possibilities for thought and action? As well as reading a range of classic and contemporary scholarly works, students in the course will have the opportunity to experiment with methods through which ethnographers and designers seek to document and interpret the social life of material things. Assignments for the course include a photo essay and two short papers. No prior knowledge of anthropology or semiotics is expected. This course is open to graduate and undergraduate students from any field.

This survey will include Dixieland, ragtime, blues, gospel, spirituals, rhythm and blues, rock, and soul. Recitations: Fall and spring terms only. Students must enroll in one of the several recitation sections that are held during the week. These sessions provide an opportunity for the student to participate in group discussions and to explore the material covered in the lectures. Registration in both lecture and one of the several recitation sections is required. Students should be sure to register for both at the time of registration  students who register for one but not the other will very likely find themselves closed out of the course when attempting to add the necessary section during the add/drop period.

         Modern archeology draws much of its theory and goals from anthropology.  This course will show how archaeologists use the fragmentary traces left by past peoples to develop an anthropological understanding of their cultures.  We will explore the variety of ways archaeologists investigate such things as prehistoric diet, social life, politics, technology, and religion.  Topics to be covered include:  the nature of archaeological information, dating techniques, interpretation of material objects, and archaeological ethics.  Studies from around the world will be used to illustrate major principles in archaeological research. The course will provide an understanding of how and why we study past societies, as well as the unique contribution archaeology can make to understanding ourselves.

         This course will examine the many different and often competing forms of Christianity that existed during the first five centuries of our Common Era. We will include an historical survey of Mediterranean culture and society in the historical Roman Empire to help us understand the ways in which Christianity developed in relation to the philosophical, sociological, theological, and political environment of this period. We will also focus on the contribution of the early varieties of Christianity to modern western views of the relationship between the individual body and society. Specifically, we will begin with an examination of Greco-Roman "religiousness" and attitudes toward the body as part of the natural order comprising one's duty as a "citizen." Such views will then be compared to the emerging Christian view that denied civic duty to an inferior, material world, by emphasizing individual identification with "a commonwealth in heaven."

Do the meanings found in a literary work come out of the individual reader's knowledge and experience, the author's intentions, or the structure and style of the work? In this course, we will engage such questions while reading a selection of poetry, fiction, and drama. These readings, from various historical periods and socio-cultural contexts, will be the basis for an exploration into the differences-often blurry and changeable-between "literary" and "non-literary" writing.

         This course examines Slavic and anglophone science fiction comparatively. It assesses how a given culture's dominant values are articulated in a popular genre that enjoys different status in the East (i.e., Eastern Europe) and the West (i.e., England and America). Those values emerge in works that imaginatively posit "fantastic" situations rooted in biological, spatial, and temporal explorations beyond those currently verified by science. On the basis of films (e.g., "The Terminator", "The Fly"), film clips, TV shows, novels (e.g., "Solaris", "The Futurological Congress"), novellas, and stories, we shall discuss such topics as progress, utopia, human perfectibility, the limits of science, and the nature of knowledge.This is a Hybrid course requiring students to attend scheduled workshops and participate in online discussions and activities.

Why do vampires capture the imagination especially of Anglophone readers? What qualities does the vampire incarnate? Which historical events and customs have triggered particular enthusiasm for depicting the undead? How have the depictions of the vampire evolved over centuries? Our discussions will address these issues as we analyze stories, novels, and films focusing on vampires from a variety of critical perspectives, contextualizing the works in the cultures that produced them.This is a Hybrid course requiring students to attend scheduled workshops and participate in online discussions and activities.

         This course is designed to provide students with a sociological perspective on medical beliefs, practices, and delivery systems.  The practice of medicine is embedded in a particular social system, and social factors have an effect on our understanding of illness, the distribution of illness in the population, how/where/by whom medicine is practiced, and also how it is paid for.  In addition, ethical decisions about life and death are based in social belief systems which evolve historically in response to technological developments and changing practice possibilities.  Students in this course will develop an understanding of how medical practices can be interpreted within a social and historical context, and will apply this knowledge to issues which are current in medicine today: the crisis in health care delivery, the effects of technological advances on conceptions of health and illness, the treatment challenge of multicultural patient populations, and ethical dilemmas in medical decision making.

    Kirk,Keith Byron

         This course explores drama in the United States from the eighteenth century to the present. An enormous topic! Yes, but the plays and articles we will read have been selected to represent a broad variety of periods, styles, and perspectives. Ours is also an exploration of drama as a lens through which we view the constantly shifting American social self. It is our opportunity to engage with both the origins and growth of the American social self through dramatic narratives. As such, we will explore the relationship of drama to social, political, and cultural forces. The course will look to social contexts, exploring supposed ideas of “canonicity”, and the importance of content/context each as guideposts toward a more complete understanding of the uniqueness of a specifically American dramatic narrative, its origins in World Drama, and its place in the construction of a multi-vocal and multifaceted American identity as what Jacques Ranciere calls “emancipated spectators”.

    Chilson,Clark Van Doren

         This course is divided into four thematic parts. The first part introduces basic knowledge on Buddhism. It then shows how the encounter between Buddhism and psychology has occurred in the wider context of Buddhist modernism, which has involved attempts by Buddhist reformers, psychologists, and neuroscientists to demythologize Buddhism to show how it can be understood as complementing modern empirical science. Part two offers concrete examples of Buddhist modernism by illustrating how Buddhist contemplative practices and doctrines such as sati have been reinterpreted and reformulated in modern psychology. Part three examines how a Japanese Zen practitioner’s presentation of Zen compares with psychotherapeutic perspectives on it. Finally, in part four, a Buddhist-inspired psychotherapy widely used in Japan is examined to show how the reformulation of Buddhism to achieve psychotherapeutic goals has occurred in modern times in East Asia, albeit in a way that is distinctive from Buddhist-inspired psychotherapeutic practices in the west.

         This course frames questions about French and francophone literature, culture and film in a global context to ask, how can one be French and global? We will investigate spaces, objects, environments, and texts (including their readers/viewers and histories) that allow us to think about articulations of, and connections between, France and the world in different transcultural, literary, and historical contexts. The course materials cover the Middles Ages to the contemporary period and include literary texts, historical documents, film, visual culture, critical readings, and online sources. Coursework and discussions are in French, enabling students to develop and refine their linguistic skills (speaking, reading, writing, and listening) throughout the semester. A Writing-Intensive course, this seminar helps students to hone their skills of literary and cultural analysis through original research in which they explore a global perspective on French and francophone studies. Students will write approximately 25 pages of work, including informal writing, short essays, and a longer research project. TAUGHT IN FRENCH

         This course will examine the sociological dimensions of literature.  In general terms, this involves considering how the creation, reception, and content of literary works are affected by the organizational and structural features of institutions and social life.  Topics to be discussed include:  the social status of authors, the various gatekeeping roles in the publishing industry, the ways in which literary works may reflect certain aspects of social life, changes in the practices of reading, and the effects of literature as a cultural product on its readers.  A term paper will be required examining a current topic in the sociology of literature.  The course will be taught using both lectures and discussions.

         The history of sport and global capitalism is designed for students seeking to make their way as professionals and/or for those interested in global sport as a social and political force both in the U.S. and around the world.  Focusing on the evolution of sport as a global industry and the creation of an imposing scholastic, community, and non-profit infrastructure, it equips students to understand and navigate those arenas.  If, after graduation, students venture into the sports industry, scholastic sport, or sport for development, they should do so with their eyes wide open.

         This course explores the impact of the Cold War on the American home front and abroad from 1945 through 1990.  We will investigate the postwar division of the world into two opposing camps through new economic, political, and military arrangements. Of particular interest will be America’s half-century encounter with nuclear weapons, their manufacture and deleterious effects on local communities and the environment in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The hunt for spies in the U.S. government, military, and entertainment industry will focus on U.S. presidents, Senators and Representatives, the FBI, labor leaders, corporate executives, and ordinary people. We will ask how the Cold War climate fostered or hindered social movements for racial equality, participatory democracy, and women’s liberation. The Korean and Vietnam Wars will be explored from an international perspective. Last but not least, we will look at how U.S. popular culture engaged some of these developments. At its close, the course will ask which hallmarks of the Cold War—from military campaigns to paranoid politics--persist in the twentieth-first century.

         This course is a survey of Roman history from the founding of the city in the 8th century B.C.E. to the collapse of the Western Empire in the 5th century C.E. The history of Rome is the story of how a city-state first unified the Italian peninsula under its military and political leadership  how it then developed into a Mediterranean Empire which, at its greatest territorial extent, stretched from Britain in the West to the Tigris and Euphrates in the East  and how it finally lost political and military control of its empire which broke apart into what became the states of Medieval Europe. As we read a modern narrative history of Rome and the works of Roman and Greek historians, we will examine how Rome acquired and governed its empire  under what forms of government and under whose leadership the affairs of the Roman People were administered  and what causes led to the breakup of the Roman Empire.

         This course introduces students to the rich scholarly literature relating media audiences (print, film, radio, television, and digital), reception theory, and cultural representations of race, class, gender, sexuality, disability, and their intersections, past and present. The course takes two perspectives: how media representations of difference are received, accepted, contested, modified broadly by audiences and how audience members marked as different engage both those representations and those of media unconcerned with representing difference. Because the emphasis is on approaches to studying audience and difference, scholarship on topics from around the world in various modern-era time periods are included as case studies. A range of exercises, some involving short field trips to local archives and museums, will provide hands-on experience in using, say, oral histories, diaries, letters, online user feedback, and photographs as evidence of response to mediated difference.  Combining one or more of these approaches, students will, in the course of the semester, develop a research project, conference proposal for presenting it, and a draft paper and “mock presentation” of the material in a conference-like setting in the classroom. That will account for half the course the grade, the remainder resulting from class discussion and exercises.

         This course takes a critical look at the narratives and discourses in and around race and its relationship to scientific thought that both essentializes and naturalizes bodies and their capabilities.  We will explore narratives which use the tool and authoritative voice of science, scientific method and genetics.  In addition, we will look at some of the historical and contemporary narratives of the biological underpinnings of race discourse and its incorporation into everyday imaginings of social identities.  We will look at blogs, internet posts, media, and academic literature to view and critique the ways in which science logic becomes racialized logic.

         The goals of the course are to introduce students to historically influential empires of the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean world: Akkad, Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Athens, and Rome. Rather than history as it is reconstructed from texts, this survey will emphasize the comparative cultural profiles of these empires as they are known from the archaeological record: the king, emperor, and in the case of Athens, the Demos, and their constituencies (elites, military, gods), the resources required to control these constituencies (essential commodities, luxuries, an expanded workforce), the visual themes and monument types that were chosen to advertise the success and promote the continuity of the regime beyond the lifetime of its founder, the use of regional themes to establish continuity with the historical past, and the cultural impact of empires on those who belonged to them and those who did not. Monument types will include: palaces and tombs, temples and booty as thank-offering for the acquisition of resources, ‘collections’ as illustrative of the regimes’ control over history and geography (i.e. gardens, zoos, museums, libraries, gifts from other monarchs), administrative buildings and institutions (law codes and their presentation).

         This course will investigate the works of some famous and not-so famous artist working in Italy between about 1400 and 1550. We will investigate cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice and examine how different communities employed images for the expression of identity, status, and as a strategic means of producing consensus or exploiting social division. We will consider the role that images occupied in political and religious culture as well as in private life, bearing in mind the competing interests of those who commissioned works of art and those who encountered them as beholders. From this multiplicity of uses and responses emerged highly varied conceptions of the nature of images and the role of the artist. The artists we will study include: the original Ninja Turtles (Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello), Botticelli, Titian and Brunelleschi, among many others.

    Clericuzio,Peter J

         Architecture: Image, Text, Theory is an upper level writing intensive [W] course required for all students wishing to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a major in Architectural Studies. The objectives are to acquaint students with architectural themes in various literary genres, to examine the emergence and development of core ideas in the Western architectural tradition, and to understand the relationship between architectural ideas and the contexts in which they were articulated. Texts examined in the course will include classic architectural treatises, texts on landscape, urbanism and aesthetics. Drawings, prints, photography, and illustrations will be considered as important components of architectural theory  the format and composition of architectural books will be considered as integral to the ideas they contain. In the spring of 2017, the course will center around the literature and media concerning Frank Lloyd Wright, since it is the 150th anniversary of Wright's birth and there are major events being held across the US and elsewhere in conjunction with it.

    Guignon,Christopher T

         The goal of this studio is to investigate concepts of sustainable design as they relate to the built environment at multiple scales: the scale of the living unit, the building, and the larger urban context. We will explore the interpretations and implications of current discourse on sustainability, giving special attention to the triple bottom line approach to sustainable design, which encourages a balanced emphasis on environment, economy, and social equity. Students will be introduced to elements of sustainable architecture (energy, air quality, water, building materials, site) and the sustainable design strategies (shading, passive ventilation, thermal mass, community connectivity, etc.) that have been developed to address problems like resource scarcity and urban depreciation. Building on the three studio sequence of the Design Track (HAA 1913, HAA 1916, HAA 1917), which equips students with an understanding of form-¬‐making and design methodology, HAA 1918 introduces a framework for design that is not just responsive to, but proactive about environmental, economic, and social issues.

         Can we speak, now, of contemporary composition, when art being made today seems so diverse in its mediums, concerns, content, and audiences as to defy coherent categorization, when the world situation is presented in communicative media, and is constantly experienced, as spinning into what seems to be confused chaos, structural disintegration, and violent disorder––that is, a state of unfathomable decomposition? At a time defined above all by the contemporaneity of divisive difference, this course will explore a variety of arguments in favor of developing common modes of social composition. It will pay special attention to the ways in which visual artists, filmmakers, architects, performance artists, curators, and cultural activists are rising to this challenge throughout the world.

         The course introduces students to interdisciplinary methods and approaches to "global studies." It draws on case studies of current global issues and trends that require students to think analytically and critically about how we approach, interpret and respond to 'global' phenomena, and about the consequences for different regions, cultures and localities. In this the usefulness, complexity and controversy of the concept of globalization as a key analytical tool is assessed, and students develop an ability to engage with core debates regarding the impact of globalization on culture, economic and social equality, politics and governance, security, and sustainable development.

We will begin with the Constitutional framework and consider how the office of the presidency has evolved over time within the American system of checks and balances. Next, we will examine the presidential selection (nomination and election) process and consider how presidents build and maintain support from the public, the media, and other political leaders for domestic, economic, and foreign policies. We will critically analyze the methods political scientists have developed to compare recent presidents in terms of their managerial styles, policy success, personalities, and relations with Congress: why are some presidents considered more effective than others, and what does this tell us about leadership in different contexts? We will conclude with a comparison of the presidency with top leadership roles in other political democracies.

         Oil and other natural resources have played a crucial role in shaping the politics, development, and foreign relations of countries in all regions of the world. While experts originally believed that natural resource wealth would be a blessing for endowed countries, we now know they often impede economic growth, reinforce authoritarianism, exacerbate corruption, and cause conflict. This course will examine the political economy of oil, natural gas, minerals, and other natural resources to gain insight into why they can be a blessing or a curse. We will explore the role of governments, oil companies, OPEC, the demand for energy security, and environmental concerns in shaping the effects of natural resources.

         How and why did sex and sexuality become subjects of study?  How are our experiences of sex and sexuality shaped by a history of "scientific" explorations of desire? Why has sexuality become so central to our understanding of identity? What was sex like before "sexuality" was invented? This seminar explores these questions by approaching sex and sexuality as socially, historically, and culturally contingent concepts. We will consider sex and sexuality as they relate to other categories of identity, including race, class, ethnicity, nation, and ability.  Our theoretical and historical investigations will create the groundwork for understanding and rethinking how sexuality is understood in culture today. Topics treated will include "sodomitical sin," "inversion," the "intermediate sex," sex ed in schools, the Kinsey report, sex work, AIDS, and the history of pornography.

         This course uses the anthropology of language and media to examine everyday life in contemporary South Asia. In it you will experiment with methods for the study of a range of media including: spoken conversations, print advertisements, social media, and digital payment systems and examine their applications in fields ranging from academic study to social policy, medicine, and industrial design. Readings, films, and activities aim to give you a sense of the variety of perspectives used to understand life in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. The course is divided into four sub-sections. “Imagining South Asia” examines how South Asia and its boundaries have been mapped and defined. “Print Publics” examines the significance of newspapers, and other print technologies in forming and informing the grounds for political participation. “Media Circulation” examines the circulation of social media, text messages, and TV-commercials in relation to morality, nationalism, and the cultivation of sentiment. Finally, “Space and Circulation” examines the relationship between commodities, spaces, and the states that regulate their movement. Assignments for the course include informal reports on class activities and a research paper. No prior knowledge of anthropology or South Asia is expected.

         This class seeks to understand the causes, processes, and consequences of long-term Maya political, cultural, and economic resistance and accommodation with reference to non-Maya outsiders. Resistance and accommodation vs. non-Maya outsiders is also related to conflicts within and among Maya communities. To maximize the potential for better understanding through synchronic and diachronic comparisons, these issues are explored with reference to a number of cases arrayed across roughly two millennia of Maya history and prehistory, covering the following periods: modern (1940 to now); republican (AD 1820-1940); colonial (AD 1520-1820); and prehispanic (AD 1-1520). Noteworthy cases to be studied include the current Guatemalan Maya cultural renaissance, the late 20th century Guatemalan state’s war against its Maya populations, an ongoing Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mayas and an indigenizing Mexican revolution and state, ongoing Maya diaspora, Revolt of the Hanged during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), Yucatec Mayas and archaeologists between World Wars I and II, Chamula Caste War (1867-1870), Yucatec Caste War (1847-1901), Totonicapan revolt (1820), Canek revolt (1761), Cancuc revolt (1708-1713), Spanish conquest (1518-1540), and elite-level exotic identity politics relative to Classic (1-1000) and Postclassic (AD 1000-1500) state formations and collapses. A variety of anthropological research methods are used. For the modern Maya the emphasis is on ethnography, for the colonial/republican Maya ethnohistory predominates, and for the prehispanic Maya the focus is on archaeology and epigraphy. To make sense of the diverse cases of conflict and accommodation, we draw on anthropological thinking about such phenomena as violent peasant rebellions, everyday resistance, ethnic nationalism, cultural essentialism, invented traditions, testimonial history, cultural renaissance (or revitalization) movements, gender and authenticity, religious conversion (& syncretism), ethnic tradition as imposed trap or chosen defense mechanism, uses of material culture for communication, and literacy.

         Lady Murasaki's eleventh-century novel The Tale of the Genji is the most famous work in classical Japanese literature and one of the most-addressed themes in Japanese art and literature during subsequent eras. It is also one of the great novels of the world. Reading and studying this fascinating text as it appears in the original text and related writing not only helps explain many key concepts in traditional Japanese culture but provides access to non-Western models for the composition of sophisticated fiction based on the interior psychology of the characters presented. Key questions that the course will address include why The Tale of the Genji was so often depicted in various written and visual forms (such as Noh plays or woodblock prints), as well as how the relationship between the original and derivative works versions changed over time. All readings are in English. This course can be taken by Department majors in conjunction with Japanese 1908, Directed Readings.

         This course will take the recent surge of success behind Korean cinema as a way to explore our object of study: Korea and the cinema. The Introduction to Korean Cinema course will explore Korean cinema in broader (and at times narrow) cultural, social, and aesthetic contexts to investigate transnational media production and circulation, globalization, consumer culture, commercialization, and construction of national, ethnic and gender identities. The ostensible purpose of the course is the provide students with the experience of Korean cinema and to develop a critical and historical consciousness of Korean visual culture. By examining a number of carefully selected films, students will explore a number of culturally diverse issues such as Korean individual and national identity, modernity, gender, culture, history through cross-cultural analysis, assessing the worth and content of the films. The course is aimed at addressing cinema both in its aesthetic specificity, as well as foregrounding these diverse issues regarding the medium, especially the conventions of realism.

         This course is designed to help students improve as critical writers by becoming more observant and discriminating evaluators of how they and others use language to interpret, judge, and ultimately shape the worlds in which they live. Students will be first asked to reflect on the behavior of critics they have encountered in an effort to define what they believe good critics do. They will then be asked to test their definitions through close attention to various writing samples, including material they select as well as pieces chosen by the instructor. In keeping with the belief that critical reflection and dialogue enable both individuals and groups to improve, the course is discussion-based, and class members' progress as writers will be its steady concern. This section is best suited for students familiar with basics of grammar and composition, interested in composing more responsible and effective written opinions, and motivated to participate in conversation about reading and writing critically.span class="B"> Students are expected to meet all assignment due dates in Self–Paced courses.

         This course introduces students to Russian fairy tales, a fascinating and productive genre of folklore that reveals a great deal about Russian traditions and modes of thought. Taking a psychological approach to the materials, the course examines not only the tales, but also the beliefs informing the magic world of these narratives. Since the humans, spirits, and beasts populating this world are richly portrayed in Russian art, a significant component of the course will consist of visual and audio representations of figures and scenes from fairy tales. We shall examine slides of posters, paintings, book illustrations, postcards, etc., and shall listen to music based on characters, situations, and narratives drawn from the tales (e.g., extracts from Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, Chaikovsky, and Mussorgsky.This is a Hybrid course requiring students to attend scheduled workshops and participate in online discussions and activities.

         Modernity means a breaking away from traditional patterns of life to a radically new way of living and thinking. Accordingly the early modern period in philosophy refers to first great break from the preceding intellectual tradition, which occurred in seventeenth century Europe. Like the modern culture that followed in its wake, the new philosophy turned away from spiritual concerns to focus on the nature of the individual mind and body, the investigation of the secular state, and the question of what constitutes a proper method for the production of knowledge on the basis of reason alone. This course will introduce students to the major strands of thought in this period by reading a number of classic authors including Descartes, Hobbes, Leibniz, and Locke.

          The plan for this seminar is to read de Anima, using Christopher Shields’ new translation and commentary (Clarendon Aristotle Series, OUP, 2016). We will be working through the text, in order. Typically, the primary text and Shields’ commentary will be paired with one classic or recent article. Our aim will be to understand precisely what problems Aristotle thinks there are in grasping the nature of soul (or “life”), and how his solutions are supposed to resolve them. We will also read parts of Parva Naturalia, Parts of Animals and Generation of Animals, to see how the discussions in those treatises flesh out the fairly abstract claims in DA and provide insight into the physiological exercise of psychic capacities.

         Semiotic anthropology examines the social life of meaning. It extends questions of representation and interpretation beyond the study of language to examine how culture orders and is ordered by the objects that surround us. Drawing on recent work in anthropology, philosophy, and industrial design this course investigates four interrelated questions: How are value and meaning assigned to objects? How does culture shape sensory perception? How are styles defined, interpreted and changed over time? How do landscapes, infrastructure, and architecture shape possibilities for thought and action? As well as reading a range of classic and contemporary scholarly works, students in the course will have the opportunity to experiment with methods through which ethnographers and designers seek to document and interpret the social life of material things. Assignments for the course include a photo essay and two short papers. No prior knowledge of anthropology or semiotics is expected. This course is open to graduate and undergraduate students from any field.

         The Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, followed by the break-up of the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a revolutionary movement, which can be studied from very different angles: by reading Gorbachev's memoirs, by studying leaflets of protest groups like the Polish Solidarity movement, or by watching footage of the proclamation of free travel on East German TV. This course introduces students to a variety of primary and secondary sources including visual sources, such as photographs and films. Students will write several short papers in response to the study of these different sources and class time will be devoted to discussing, critiquing, and revising written work.

It will look at topics such as empire, politics, economics, cultural commentary, art, literature, the emergence of new academic disciplines, and the development of new schools of thought at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth. As it engages these problems of Modernism, it will introduce students to philosophies and methodologies of History and it will explore different genres of writing within the discipline.  It will provide students the opportunity to conduct research and write short-to-medium length papers on topics within the history of European Modernism.

         One of the most familiar, but least understood, groups in American history are the Puritans who settled New England in the 17th century.  This course introduces students to the ways historians work by allowing them to address key questions regarding the unique identity of the New England Puritans. Students will be encouraged to develop their own assessment of the Puritan social, political, economic and religious legacy.  Due to their intellectual sophistication and commitment to creating a godly society in the North American wilderness, New England’s Puritans were almost constantly engaged in theological, social, political and economic controversies. These controversies, their commitment to scripture, and their high level of literacy, created a substantial paper trail.  Due to both their stature in American history, and this wealth of documentation, the Puritan legacy has been hotly contested since the earliest generation of American historians.  Through primary documents and secondary literature students will analyze not only the nature of Puritan New England, but also how it has been perceived by various generations of historians.  Students will become part of this historical debate by writing several short analytical papers using primary and secondary documents and discussing their findings in class discussions and debates.

         After the Civil War, the United States attempted to resolve its original sin and begin the process of establishing true equality under the law for all of its citizens. In doing so, a larger revolution was unleashed that radically altered the nation’s economy, federal law, notions of race, class, and gender, and the role of the government in the lives of everyday Americans. In this seminar, students will be introduced to the historian’s craft by exploring a variety of primary sources written during the Reconstruction era, as well as a number of secondary sources that highlight the fraught relationship Reconstruction has had within both the historical discipline and the memory of the American public. A longer research paper is due at the end of term. In-class revision and discussion of students’ written work form an important part of the course.

         The course surveys the emergence and growth of early African civilization from the beginnings of the evolution of the human race to the eve of the European colonization of the continent. It introduces students to the multiple disciplines contributing to knowledge about early Africa, and shows the centrality of Africa and Africans for humanity in general. It presents the long history of Africans and their roles, at different times and in different parts of the continent. It begins with their migration, and their agricultural innovation, leading to the creation of growth of larger and more complex societies and polities  the development of new kinds of economic and social relations, and the invention and spread of new ideas, tools, institutions, and modes of artistic and cultural expression that led to emergence of states, kingdoms, and empires. Among the principal themes that the readings and discussions focus on are: Pre-history of Africa and the genesis of humankind  the complexity of migration, and state formation  and African and European earlier contact. Its basic goal is to promote, an appreciation of Africa’s contributions to world civilization.

         Delirium and alterity (becoming other) are fertile manifestations of relations of coloniality. Relations of coloniality include dominance, complicity, alliance, endosymbiosis, transformation and resistance. Coloniality must be understood as a range of ongoing manifold processes that transcend the formal colonial or neocolonial status of specific countries, and tend to reproduce themselves at all levels of social and cultural practice as part of the global development of modern industrial society, to include class, race, gender, interspecies relations and myriad forms of subalternity. This course will examine a representative hemispheric sample of twentieth and twenty-first century short stories and short novels in this regard: João Guimarães Rosa (Brazil), selected short fiction  Enrique Bernardo Núñez (Venezuela), Cubagua  Clarice Lispector (Brazil), selected short fiction  Antonio di Benedetto (Argentina), Mundo animal –short stories, selection  Frankétienne (Haiti), A punto de reventar  Quince Duncan (Costa Rica), Los cuatro espejos  Andrés Caicedo (Colombia), Calicalabozo –short stories, selection  Alejandro Rebolledo (Venezuela), Pim, pam, pum  Guillermo Fadanelli, Mariana Constrictor –short stories, selection  Carlos Labbé (Chile), Caracteres blancos –short stories, selection  Lucía Puenzo (Argentina), El niño pez  Samantha Schweblin (Argentina), Pájaros en la boca –short stories, selection  Rita Indiana Hernández (Dominican Republic), La mucama de Ominculé  Pedro Cabiya (Puerto Rico), Transfusión  and Eduardo Luis Angualusa (Angola), Barroco tropical. Theoretical reflections by Frantz Fanon, Aníbal Quijano, and Donna Haraway will be part of the discussion. Language of instruction is Spanish. Class discussion will be based on Spanish editions of all fiction, including works originally written in Portuguese (Brazil and Angola) and French (Haiti). Students may handle available translations in English. Class work and papers may be presented in Spanish or English.

         This course will explore ways that writing is used to support health and medical professions, and more generally, ways that language and communication patterns affect perceptions, dynamics, and outcomes in health and medical contexts. A blend of theory, narrative analysis, and practical concerns, the course will review developments in the emerging field of medical rhetoric as a foundation for discussions of topics such as health equity, patient-centered communication models, and the role of phenomenology in defining pain, illness, and disability. Students will write documents commonly used in clinical and research settings such as case reports, correspondence, conference presentation materials, and medical literature reviews, and they will also develop a paper and presentation on a health and medical communication sub-topic. This writing intensive (‘W’) course is appropriate for students planning on becoming doctors, medical researchers, health care administrators, public health advocates, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, physical therapists, nurses, rehabilitation therapists, hospice workers, social workers, medical sociologists, medical writers, communication specialists, and other related professionals, as well as anyone who is interested in exploring the role of written communication in health and medicine.

         This course attempts to provide an understanding of American post-World War II foreign policy behavior. We will  examine both the international system of which the United States is a component part, as well as attributes of the U.S. domestic scene which influence policy decisions and directions. In the process, the student  will be provided with a general understanding of the chronology of recent international events as well as a feel for the scope and substance of disagreement over various policies. The materials examined for this class  should be suggestive of alternative policy directions for the future.

         This writing-intensive section of Imagining Social Justice focuses on the evolution of dystopian literature. Students will define the characteristics, history and purpose of dystopian lit by examining examples of the narrative type written during the Twentieth century. The student will then compare the historical characteristics and purpose with those of dystopian literature written after the tragedy of 9/11. The course will end by extrapolating the future trajectory of the narrative type. As a writing intensive section, the course will require the student to practice significant levels of writing and revision, as well as basic competency in higher order argumentation skills.

    Thomas,Lenore D

         This course partners advanced Studio Arts majors with a faculty member as a teaching assistant in a current departmental course. The partnership is intended to offer further experience to dedicated students exploring a particular media with mentorship in studio management and an introduction to teaching, will enhance the course by offering enrolled students additional support and access for skill development and questions throughout the term, and will offer faculty valuable studio management and assistance in working with students. With the diversity of courses, media, and faculty, each UTA experience will be unique. Given this, there is no official syllabus though a contract (signed by student, faculty member, and department chair) is required in order to gain a permission number to register for course credit. SA 1904 may be taken for 1-3 course credits depending on the level of involvement appropriate to each course and is an upper-level elective that can be repeated in different courses, though only 3 credits may be applied toward elective credit given a student’s progress within the major. SA 1904 is an S/N course (pass/fail - satisfactory/unsatisfactory) and is not taken for a letter grade. PREQ: Minimum of 30 credits already earned in Studio Arts prior to registration.

    Campbell,Lori M.

         This course studies J.K. Rowling’s famous boy wizard and his world, its contexts, and its impact. The course follows the story arc, character and magical-world construction based on considerations of genre (low fantasy, children’s literature), culture (race, class, gender, ethics, politics), and universal experience (love, death, heroism, child-adult relations, coming-of-age).  Readings include comparable novels by authors other than Rowling, as well as scholarship on the Potter series and on the phenomena rising out of it, not only in terms of controversy such as the attacks of the religious right, but also in the social and political activism of the Harry Potter Alliance.  You will be expected to synthesize the critical readings with your own reading of the fiction to formulate your ideas in class and in your written work.  In addition to studying the series in terms of its own embedded politics and symbolic meanings, we will also to tackle the larger issue of the book as a cultural construct, and the more difficult question of where to place Rowling and her writing in literary history, i.e. to what extent (or not) the series can be viewed as a “classic.”

         This course reviews the development of reactor safety concepts, the emergence of safety strategies and culture, and the perspectives of severe accidents and how they can be mitigated.  Risk-influenced regulatory practices will be introduced and quantitative use of probabilistic risk assessment will be described in terms of its use as a guide to intelligent decision-making.  The characteristics of accident progression in the reactor vessel and containment in the unlikely event of core melting and relocation of fuel material will be explained.  Offsite impacts of such severe accidents will be introduced.  Source terms, dispersion of radionuclides, and dose projections will be developed for both conservative and realistic evolutions.  Protective actions and emergency preparedness will be introduced.  This course will cover the regulatory aspects of nuclear operations and the roles that the NRC, INPO, WANO and the IAEA play and what impact each has on plant operations. An introduction into regulatory requirements, the safety analysis report, nuclear safety and licensing, and whistle-blower rules will be provided.

         This course reviews the development of reactor safety concepts, the emergence of safety strategies and culture, and the perspectives of severe accidents and how they can be mitigated.  Risk-influenced regulatory practices will be introduced and quantitative use of probabilistic risk assessment will be described in terms of its use as a guide to intelligent decision-making.  The characteristics of accident progression in the reactor vessel and containment in the unlikely event of core melting and relocation of fuel material will be explained.  Offsite impacts of such severe accidents will be introduced.  Source terms, dispersion of radionuclides, and dose projections will be developed for both conservative and realistic evolutions.  Protective actions and emergency preparedness will be introduced.  This course will cover the regulatory aspects of nuclear operations and the roles that the NRC, INPO, WANO and the IAEA play and what impact each has on plant operations. An introduction into regulatory requirements, the safety analysis report, nuclear safety and licensing, and whistle-blower rules will be provided.

         The class focuses on short stories in the context of the lives of major writers from different cultures such as Argentina, Canada, France, Russia, and the US.  We use the events of their lives and especially their thinking on sexuality to shape our reading of the stories they write including films based on these tales. Authors include Chekhov, Maupassant, Faulkner, Borges, and Munro. (satisfies GEC Writing & Lit., English Writing Major, English Minor, Gender, Sexuality/Women’s and also the Latin American Studies certificate requirement).

    Crosby,Emily Deering

         What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework. Check the individual section to determine whether the section is a 'W' section.

         This course offers a survey of micro-analytical, microscopy and diffraction methods that are widely used for the analysis of composition, chemistry, structure, scale and morphology of advanced materials. It introduces the most basic concepts required to understand experimental data obtained with these modern techniques. The main objectives of the course are to enable students to interpret and evaluate relevant data sets presented in the research literature and to identify experimental tools to solve a given nano-research characterization problem. Some prerequisite basic knowledge of the structure of solid matter (e.g. crystals and amorphous materials), diffraction methods (e.g. X-Ray diffraction) and processing-property-structure relationships in materials is expected.

         Sculpture Studio 1 is a broadly based course that introduces students to the expressive potential of modeled and constructed form. Throughout the course, students experience a variety of sculpture techniques and materials in projects that study certain characteristics of natural and abstract form. The principle goals of the course are to develop skills and to provide a basis for individual creative development. From this course, students should gain sensitivity in the observation of form, develop analytic and compositional skills and begin to formulate ideas through practical experience. The individual must purchase basic sculpture tools. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $30.00 lab fee.

         This course has two objectives: First, giving students hands-on experience responding to public policy issues by analyzing micro data. Second, providing students a level of intuition regarding appropriate tools for each level of analysis, and be able to criticize results of inappropriately used tools. A principal component of this class is an in-depth analysis of welfare measures (indicators, measurements, profiles, and policy implications). Students will use income/expenditure and consumption surveys to calculate and graph a range of indicators for different countries, compare government policies and reactions and conclude the extent at which policy implementation worked for the welfare of the poor. The goal is not to turn you into an expert in econometrics or regression analysis, but to provide you with a working knowledge of different techniques in these areas. Students will be “briefly” introduced to survey design and implementation, and engage in data management: modifying, reshaping, collapsing, combining, and working across variables  Data cleaning: dealing with outliers, duplicates, and missing variables. Most importantly, finding proxies (or generate indices) to replace a critical variable that is not available in the data or incorrectly handled at the entry level. The rest of the course will be devoted to answer specific policy questions, for example: 1) to what extent an increase (or an imposition of) a minimum/living wage would affect wage workers, as well as non-wage workers? which group is likely to suffer the most?; 2) do private returns to education differ by the number of years or by the certificate type (i.e. certification/sheep skin effect); 3) by analyzing the wage structure by industry/occupation/product type (using firm level surveys) we may find some clues on whether there is a mismatch between the skill level of workers and the demand for specific skills. The analysis may later recommend sectors of the economy that in need of intervention. The main statistical package we will be using throughout the course is STATA.

         In this course we will examine the contexts for and rhetorical dimensions of a variety of professional documents, including those documents students produce in the course itself. Major assignments include a set of career materials (resume, cover letter, career report); a correspondence packet that addresses a conflict  a proposal  and a longer report based on research and analysis. As we engage in this work we will explore the nature of professionalism, common features and efforts (enabling and disabling) of professional discourse, and strategies for negotiating the "borders" of specialized and non-specialized discourse.

    Fitzpatrick,Jessica Lynn

         What is literature? Is it meant to educate? Inspire? Heal? Entertain? Transcend or confront? Do the meanings found in a literary work come out of the individual reader's knowledge and experience, the author's intentions, or the structure and style of the work? In this course, we will engage such questions while reading a selection of poetry, fiction, and drama. These readings, from various historical periods and socio-cultural contexts, will be the basis for an exploration into the differences-often blurry and changeable-between "literary" and "non-literary" writing. At the same time, as we consider the uses, qualities, and effects of literature, we will examine, apply, and reflect upon a set of strategies for reading challenging creative works.

         Introduces students to the challenge of managing in complex contemporary environments. The course is team-taught, reflective of the breadth of issues that underlies the business curriculum. A team-based and experientially focused emphasis is designed to promote student awareness of real-world business developments and develop practical skills as well as fundamental knowledge and abilities. The intellectual core of the course will emphasize a holistic and strategic inquiry of the driving forces of competitive markets, the importance of history, the complexity of resource allocation under uncertainty, and the need to develop firm-specific capabilities that are flexible and responsive to changing situations. Attention will also be paid to the construction of criteria for firm success that reflect the complex interactions of ethical, societal, legal, and economic demands. Considerable time will be devoted to the study and analysis of companies.

         The independent study option permits students in good academic standing to design Public and Professional Writing (PPW) courses of their own with the approval of a department faculty member. The independent study must integrate both the theory and practice of some aspect of public and/or professional writing, and the student must conduct research that will allow him or her to contextualize the writing forms and content being studied. Students typically write at least 30 pages (or 7,500 words) over the course of the term, and revision plays a significant role in the student's work. In addition, the student and sponsoring faculty member define a reading list and other required research, which may include interviews or surveys. The student and faculty member will agree on other work, such as essays or documents and a journal or other response to the research. Whenever possible, the student will create a final document that can be used by an intended audience or in a professional portfolio. Students are required to submit a proposal to a faculty member of their choice--usually, this faculty member is comfortable with the subject matter of the study and has worked with the student in the past. The specific form for requesting this faculty approval can be obtained from the Director or Associate Director of PPW in M-2 Thaw Hall. The form requires a description of the project you are proposing, what you expect to learn from it, the reading and research you will do, the products you will create as a result of your study, and the ways in which your sponsor will engage with your work. You should expect to meet with your sponsor at least eight times during the term. Please note that the study proposed must not duplicate the content of regularly offered courses. The purpose of this option is to complement a student's program by permitting him or her to design a course not covered by the curriculum. It is not designed to permit students to avoid taking regularly offered courses.

         In today's marketplace, proposals produce billions of dollars to help solve problems and support causes that people care about. Grant proposals make possible important research in the natural, behavioral, and social sciences; they enable many to benefit from civic and educational projects; and they benefit community development and fund artistic achievement. Other types of proposals allow people to start businesses, create change on the job, and define projects that meet the needs of particular audiences. This course will allow students to understand the functions and conventions of proposals, the types of research that they require, and the processes that generate them and lead to approval. Students will focus on two main issues: developing a proposal (which includes activities such as defining needs, reviewing existing projects and literature, and, if seeking a grant, researching sources of funds) and writing a proposal with a specific audience in mind. Coursework will help students develop an understanding of proposal writing from an initial idea through final submission. Students will complete a variety of written pieces leading up to the final proposal, which may be valuable in their employment portfolios. Upon completion of this course, students will have acquired the research and writing skills necessary to write successful proposals.

         This course will analyze the leadership role of the presidency in the American political system. We will begin with the Constitutional framework and consider how the office of the presidency has evolved over time within the American system of checks and balances. Next, we will examine the presidential selection (nomination and election) process and consider how presidents build and maintain support from the public, the media, and other political leaders for domestic, economic, and foreign policies. We will critically analyze the methods political scientists have developed to compare recent presidents in terms of their managerial styles, policy success, personalities, and relations with Congress: why are some presidents considered more effective than others, and what does this tell us about leadership in different contexts? We will conclude with a comparison of the presidency with top leadership roles in other political democracies. Students are expected to meet all assignment due dates in Self–Paced courses. This is a Self–Paced course. Workshop attendance is strongly advised or required. Saturday Workshop dates: 1/14, 2/11, 3/18, 4/1/2017.

         Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

         This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual and automated tests, test- driven and behavior-driven development, performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing process. The course is project-oriented, with students working in groups on specific deliverables on various software products, as would be expected in an industry setting.

         This "W" course is an introduction to the theoretical treatment of the real numbers, sets, functions, sequences, and limits. Classwork and homework will concentrate on the writing and understanding of proofs of theorems centered on these topics. For most students, the techniques of reading and doing proofs will be new. Two recitations per week, therefore, are required to practice this skill as well as to rehearse the many definitions of mathematical concepts in the course. It is required for all Mathematics and Statistics majors except for Departmental Honors majors who may wish to accelerate by substituting Mathematics 0450 for 0413 and 0420, and then taking Advanced Calculus. One-letter grade rule applies if there is a common final exam.

    Jones,Nicholas F 

         The course presents an overview of the legal systems of ancient Greece (especially classical Athens) and Rome, with particular attention to the interconnections of law with the ancient Greek and Roman societies.  Within this general framework, the instructor will emphasize the following themes: (1) legal interventions in private life (for example, the family, marriage, reproduction, sexual morality, religion and voluntary associations); (2) the differential design and enforcement of the law according to social class, gender and so on; (3) the dynamic interaction of law and society within the wider context of historical change; and (4) survivals of classical law in modern, and especially our own, legal systems.  The purposes of the course are to gain a deeper understanding of an important aspect of the classical civilizations and to acquire a better appreciation of the classical civilizations and to acquire a better appreciation of the classical antecedents of our own legal system.  The course will be organized around two modern overviews in English of the law of classical Athens and Rome, with the syllabus divided into Greek and Roman halves and each week's work geared to a specific topic or aspect.  Where appropriate, readings will be supplemented by slides and videos.

         In this course we aim to understand the fundamental structure and workings of modern capitalist society.  We will examine the distribution of wealth, income, and power in both the US and globally, and consider the notions of democracy and imperialism in the context of what we broadly call, “globalization.”  Can we have political equality in societies with high degrees of economic inequality?  Are corporations too powerful?  Whose side does government usually take – the “little guy’s” or the corporations’?  Why?  How is it possible that the richest nation in the world also has more poverty than any other ‘democratic’ country?  We will explore these and many other topics from the macro- to the micro- levels of analysis

Experiencing Globalization

    Rouse, Roger 

         Globalization over the last four decades has been characterized by dramatic increases in the mobility of people, money, goods, and images over long distances and across multiple national boundaries.  It has also been characterized by growing inequalities.  How have these developments affected the conditions under which people live and labor in different parts of the world?  How have they affected their health?  And how have they reconfigured the ways in which our own experiences of life, health, and labor are related to the experiences of others, both far away and near at hand?  This course offers you the chance to move beyond whatever introductory work you've done on global issues via an exploration of people’s varied involvements in "commodity chains," the mechanisms that connect the goods people consume to processes such as raw-material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, sales, and disposal.  Specifically, we will focus on chains for foods, electronics, illegal drugs, and medicines, all of which are increasingly organized along transnational lines and associated with long-distance migrations.

    Weinkle, Jonathan 

         The American culture of the 20th and 21st centuries has been called not death-defying, but death-denying. It is often said that America is the only place in the world that treats death as optional. Once upon a time, we could not have open, public conversations about breast cancer, because the word could not be uttered aloud. In many places, it is just as hard today to have an open, public conversation about death and dying. This phenomenon is not just a social more; it affects the practice of many professions and entire segments of our economy and society. This course explores our individual and cultural reactions to mortality, religious ideas about death, the ways in which dying in today’s America is different from dying throughout history or elsewhere in the world, and the responses of a variety of professions, both within the field of healthcare and beyond, to their encounters with people in the various stages of dying. Students will be asked, at turns, to be scientific, philosophical, clinical, analytical, and emotional in encountering the concepts and material presented here. This should be a true interdisciplinary experience.

While the emphasis is on practical usage, theoretical aspects of the finer points of syntax will also be considered, including preterite/imperfect, ser/estar,  indicative/subjunctive, etc.  It is the intention of the instructor to run the class in a workshop type format rather than in a formal lecture style.  In other words, students should complete their assignments before coming to class so that class time can be spent not only reviewing homework but also analyzing the concepts and applying them to translations, short writing tasks and other assignments.  Because the text is written in Spanish, it may take a short period of adjustment to get used to understanding and using linguistic terms in Spanish.  Students are expected to be able to conjugate verbs accurately in all tenses.  The course will be taught entirely in Spanish.

         This section of the Short Story will be devoted to the readings from 19th and 20th Century Russian literature. We will spend a good portion of our class sessions discussing the readings. The authors we will read range from 19th century favorites--Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov--to 20th century masters--Babel, Zamiatin, and Zoshchenko--right up to the most popular writers in Russia today--from Solzhenitsyn to Petrushevskaya and Tolstaya. Russians have always valued the short story as a source of wisdom and knowledge as well as entertainment and aesthetic pleasure, as a resource for understanding themselves as individuals in a complex society, as a means for analyzing social behavior and psychological relationships, and as a place for airing cultural issues and matters of political and social concern. As we read and discuss these stories, we will be asking shy these authors selected the short story rather than poetry, the novel, or drama for their inventions and fantasies, philosophies, and teachings, and why and how they expressed their views and values as they did using particular forms of language, imagery, and narrative structures. We will compare Russian and American ideas and values, considering both our cultural similarities and differences. We will both discuss the shared themes expressed in these stories and try to identify their particular national stereotypes and peculiar "Russian" characteristics. We will examine common and uncommon emotions and passions, customs, and mores, beliefs, fantasies, and dreams. Finally, we will attempt to draw conclusions about our own values, feelings, assumptions, reactions, and prejudices and their sources as we respond to the expressions of issues and problems raised in the short story literature of a different and fascinating culture.

    Platt, Jonathan Brooks 

         In 1866, in an apartment building in St. Petersburg, Russia, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov decides to “rid the world of evil” by murdering an old pawnbroker with an axe. The complex actions of this young student—the protagonist of Dostoevskii’s novel Crime and Punishment (1866)—have since inspired a number of texts that address, develop, and re-cast the questions that Dostoevsky raises. Taking Crime and Punishment as a starting point, this course will trace representations of the superior individual in monumental European texts (literature, film, drama, and music) from the nineteenth century, with works like Tolstoi’s “The Kreutzer Sonata” (1889), through the twentieth century, with texts such as Hesse’s (1917), Camus’s The Stranger (1942), and Hitchcock’s Rope (1948), and ending with contemporary works such as Kalin’s film Swoon (1992) and Logan’s play Never the Sinner (1999). As a supplement we will read philosophical and theoretical works by Berdiaev, Schopenhauer, Solov'ev, Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, which specifically address the theme of the literary Superman. We will also examine questions of adaptation as the Superman is transformed through literature, film, philosophy, drama, and music.

The course will first examine the causes of environmental issues. We will explore the degree to which public opinion, institutions, ideology, and global collective action problems contribute to these problems. In the second half, we will evaluate solutions to these issues. We will both look at how countries have dealt with them in the past, and think about what could be done to solve current issues.

         This is a standard introductory course in microeconomics. It focuses on the way the market system works. The decisions of households, firms, and governments are coordinated through markets in which prices adjust to keep buying plans and selling plans consistent. The U.S. economy relies mainly on markets to coordinate these decisions, although sometimes governments intervene. We will explore various social issues using the principles developed throughout the course. Upon completion of the course students will have a better understanding of economic problems, efficiency, laws of demand and supply, consumer choice theory, market organization, production and cost.

         We find dancing in every world culture and throughout history, but the dances of each place and time are specific, distinctive, and ever changing. This makes dance both an excellent and a problematic subject for cultural and historical comparisons. The Global History of Dance investigates the types, uses, and understandings of dance across the globe and examines shifting attitudes and practices from the Renaissance to today. We will consider themes such as dance as a spiritual practice, a tool of the state,  and an expression of personal identity, and we will examine a broad diversity of styles, from belly dance to b-boying to ballet to bharata natyam. Participatory workshops and video viewing assignments will supplement lectures and readings, and students will write a performance review, as well as a research paper.

         On 1898 Spain lost its empire during the Spanish–American War.  Portugal, instead, preserved its empire for most of the 20th century. This divergence resulted in different developments such as a Civil War in Spain (1936-1939) and a political revolution in Portugal (1974). However, both countries also shared similar experiences such as long lasting authoritarian regimes, democratic transitions, and incorporation into the European Community. The course Spain and Portugal in the 20th Century tackles the singular histories of these two countries, compares between their trajectories, enquires upon their connections, and places them in global context.

         The Fifteen-Year War, 1931-1945, was Japan’s protracted war of aggression in Asia and the Pacific region. This lecture-discussion course will examine Japan’s empire-wide policy shifts and sequence of major events leading to and through the conclusion to this war, while also taking a close look at the human costs of war thorough a close reading of eyewitness accounts. This is accomplished through assessments of various local, rather than simply national, experiences. Perspectives examined include those of marginalized groups within the Japanese empire, African Americans, Japanese Americans, Pacific Islanders, and other groups in Asia and the Pacific. Students should leave this course with an enhanced understanding of the main reasons this war was fought, the watershed events of this war, the experiences of diverse groups of people affected by this war, and the politics of war memory today.

         Painting Studio 1 is an introduction to techniques of oil painting and diverse subject matter for compositional development and creative expression. Painting assignments focus on color mixing and methods of paint application in compositions developed from observation of still-life arrangements, analysis of pre-existing images and concepts relating to non-representational painting. The purpose of the course is to promote sensitivity to color interaction, advance technical skills, and provide a basis for creative growth and exploration. Students can expect to do some drawing in Painting Studio 1. The course requires purchase of a specialized tool and materials kit from the University of Pittsburgh Bookstore. Painting Studio 1 is a required course for art majors and satisfies the creative expression requirement for non-art majors. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

         This course examines the development of modern and contemporary art in Latin America in relation to broader political, social, and economic forces. Latin America offers rich examples of artists and architects who worked in the service of governmental regimes during the twentieth century, such as Diego Rivera in Mexico and Oscar Niemeyer in Brazil. However, we will also consider cases in which artists employed artworks to challenge or subvert political repression, as occurred in Ecuador in the 1930s and in Chile during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Beyond politics, this course focuses on the tensions—indigenous vs. cosmopolitan, urban vs. rural, and rich vs. poor—that have informed the production and reception of art and architecture in Latin America since the nineteenth century. Visits to local museums will provide opportunities to consider the contributions of artists from Latin America to the production of global modern and contemporary art.

         This course is designed as an introduction to the philosophical issues that exist at the intersection of psychology and medicine. Among others, we will examine the following questions: What does it mean to be healthy? Can one define health and sickness purely objectively? Should human medical judgments (e.g., clinicians’ judgments) be replaced by purely automatic, computerized procedures? What is the nature of medical expertise? Are medical judgments influenced by various biases and can these biases be overcome? Are psychiatric disorders real? How should scientists explain psychiatric disorders? The goal of this class is to provide students with a critical understanding of these philosophical issues. Previous knowledge of biology, psychology, and medicine is not needed for this class.

    Kuchinskaya,Olga 

         The course explores interconnections between power and forms of knowledge and desire. We begin with Michel Foucault’s description of the panopticon, a technique of social control that promotes self-disciplining subjects. We then focus on how power struggles shape what we know and don’t know, forms of discipline we encounter, who we become, and what we desire in a variety of contemporary contexts.  Examples are drawn from the studies of organizational cultures, new media and surveillance, expertise, social movements, sexuality, and identity production.

         The purpose of this course is to provide the student with the basic principles of nutrition as it relates to health, fitness, and sport.  Students will need to have an understanding of both nutrition, as well as exercise physiology in order to comprehend sports nutrition. The course will discuss adequate nutrition that is required by exercise and sport and is vital to support these activities.  A wide variety of topics will be discussed and reviewed relating to nutrition in conjunction with an active lifestyle.  The student should then be able to apply this knowledge in analyzing and evaluating an active individual’s diet and be able to then make nutrition recommendations within his/her scope of practice.  This course will use an online format in order to facilitate adoption of the material.

         Like other Seminars in Composition, this introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. This particular seminar will include readings that consider issues of teaching and learning in American education, and for this reason may be of special interest to students who plan to become teachers. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, the course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing and education.

    Aziz,Jeffrey 

         This course will explore our culture’s two-thousand-year-old fascination with end times.  In various media including text, film, and one video game, we will examine visions and revisions of the unmaking of the world that begin with the biblical Revelation of St. John and continue to contemporary popular culture.  Students will discover that they already know a lot about reading Christian allegory and iconography, and will find that knowledge challenged (and hopefully enriched) in a psychedelic landscape of heavenly thrones, lakes of fire, and many-headed beasts.  The genre of “apocalypse” might sound like a depressing one, but you will be astonished how much fun can be had tromping across this blasted, often radioactive wasteland, peopled with mutants, strange gods, the living dead, and conquering aliens.  Yes: there will be love among the ruins.  Along the way, we will explore the manner in which apocalyptic narratives emerge from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures and never quite forget where they came from.  Works examined in the course will include Frank Herbert’s Whipping Star, George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, Philip K. Dick’s The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, and the game Half Life 2: Episode One.

We will read poetry, fiction, and nonfiction prose by the major romantic authors in order to consider how they participate in changing notions of nature in the early industrial era.  Throughout, we will be attentive both to the literary qualities of romantic writings about nature and to their historical and political contexts.

         The study of masculinity and of men as gendered beings is now a major component of gender studies across the disciplines and one of the most cutting-edge wings of gender studies. Informed by work in feminist, queer, and sexuality studies, what has been termed “masculinity studies” assumes that men and masculinity—in their numerous, complicated variations—are “texts” that can be analyzed from a gendered perspective. No longer are men considered as the incarnation of the universal (“the measure of all things”) or as an unmarked category, and no longer is masculinity the exclusive domain of cisgender men.

    Crosby,Emily Deering 

         Popular culture is often defined as a collection of ideas, images, beliefs and practices that have become an essential component of peoples' daily lives. While popular culture is dismissed by some as merely a mass consumer culture, others acknowledge that contemporary popular cultural forms may, in keeping with a history of once contemporary popular art, culture, and literature (e.g. Dickens, Warhol, etc.) Come to be understood as essential, canonical and elite. Ultimately, these materials may be read as a texts that inform our understanding of culture and social life and prompt such questions as: how does popular culture (re)construct our sense of "ordinary" life as something extraordinary? Why are some cultural forms dismissed and others more readily accepted? What social processes bring cultural forms into the public domain? This course will examine popular culture in a variety of forms such as: music, art, television, collectibles, internet, and social media. Students will consider examples from Western, non-Western, and "global" culture, but will use sex and sexuality, gender, and ideas of race to understand the relationship between popular culture, material culture, representation, and consumerism, and power and resistance. It will also address these phenomenon over time. This course will make especially strong use of contemporary and popular media such as video clips, internet media and images, and music.

         It is often claimed that there is a tension between love and justice: love is of particular individuals as such and essentially partial, while justice requires a kind of impartiality that treats each individual on a par with all others.  Yet there are lines of thought – running from Socrates and the Cynics, via Plato and the Stoics, to Iris Murdoch, Martin Luther King Jr., and others – that see love and justice as inseparable from one another.  The seminar will study, selectively, such lines of thought, taking as its point of departure the “upside down” conception of politics advanced by Plato’s Socrates: politics as a kind of care of one’s own soul and goading of others to care for theirs.  Important foci will be (1) the nature – especially the epistemology – of love and its connections (complementary and/or antagonistic) to justice; (2) ideal versus non-ideal theory in ethics; and (3) theory versus anti-theory (with emphasis on the nature of moral experience, especially love). I am not yet entirely sure what we’ll read, but I will certainly include works of Plato, Iris Murdoch and Martin Luther King Jr, and very probably works of Sara Ruddick, Eddie Glaude, and Greg Moses.

         The Global History seminar aims to provide History graduate students and Global Studies B.Phil students with tools to conceptualize, conduct research, analyze sources for, and/or refine a historical essay or research project. Students will develop or sharpen projects that analyze far-reaching questions from the perspective of one locale; span multiple sites; consider trends affecting diverse world regions; or otherwise engage various kinds of connections between the local and the global. Over the course of the semester we will read selected texts that address a range of methodological approaches and problems; engage in hands-on analysis of diverse types of archival sources; and carry out a series of writing assignments. As with any inquiry, we will approach the topic with a critical sensibility, considering both the possibilities and limits of global history and contemplating creatively how we might combine micro and macro approaches in ways germane to each student’s area of interest.

         This course provides an introduction to core methods for analyzing geo-spatial data, questions and applications with an emphasis on spatial and cluster analysis of point data using ArcGIS desktop. It will focus on teaching students the principles of GIS through computer-based exercises. Classroom projects will train students in acquiring, constructing, and managing geo-spatial data in order to solve spatially explicit problems. Exercises and projects will be geared toward equipping students with the set of quantitative tools that are relevant to courses taught in the urban studies program, especially courses taken by students in the planning and politics concentrations. This will provide students with the background for pursuing advanced work in urban economic geography, public administration, economic and community development, and regional analysis. However, the core methods presented in this course form the foundation for quantitative work in political science, sociology, and economics as well. This is a self-contained course. Students who have taken courses in Introduction to GIS or Introductory Statistics will find such courses useful, but they are not essential.

         The Holocaust—that is, the genocide of six million Jews in Nazi-Occupied Europe during World War II—was a critical event of the early twentieth century that continues to resonate today. Our historical survey looks at the Holocaust primarily through the experiences of its Jewish victims, though we discuss some of the other groups, such as the Roma, disabled people, and gays and lesbians, who were also targeted and systematically murdered by the Nazis. Additionally, we think about the perpetrators of the Holocaust and the ideologies that led to the genocide, such as racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism. Finally, we move beyond the history of the Holocaust to think about the ways that this event has been remembered and reconstructed by survivors, nations, institutions, museums, the arts, popular culture, and the media. Looking at how institutions here in Pittsburgh commemorate the Holocaust offers us local, concrete examples of how people continue to grapple with this history.

         The Holocaust—that is, the genocide of six million Jews in Nazi-Occupied Europe during World War II—was a critical event of the early twentieth century that continues to resonate today. Our historical survey looks at the Holocaust primarily through the experiences of its Jewish victims, though we discuss some of the other groups, such as the Roma, disabled people, and homosexual men, who were also targeted and systematically murdered by the Nazis. Additionally, we will discuss the perpetrators of the Holocaust and the ideologies that led to the genocide, such as racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism. Finally, we move beyond the history of the Holocaust to think about the ways that this event has been remembered and reconstructed by survivors, nations, institutions, museums, the arts, popular culture, and the media. Looking at how institutions here in Pittsburgh commemorate the Holocaust offers us local, concrete examples of how people continue to grapple with this history.

         How did a Jewish teenager named Henriette Herz become the belle of Berlin high society in the late 18th century? And why did Ray Frank, a Jewish woman from San Francisco who did not think that women should be rabbis, feel compelled to lead the first high holiday service ever held in Spokane, Washington? Why did Zionist thinkers like Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau think it so important to transform Jewish men into “muscle Jews,” and how did gender affect the way that Jewish men and Jewish women experienced the horrors of the Holocaust? These are some of the questions that we ask in Gender in Jewish History, a course that places gender and its effects at the center of Jewish modernity. We take an international approach to this history, traveling through Europe, the Americas, and the middle east to show how Jews negotiated gender identity and gender roles in numerous contexts and under varying political and social circumstances. In exploring such themes as religious practice, politics, education, anti-semitism, work, and family, we see how gender indelibly marked every aspect of Jewish life over the past two hundred years.

         This course explores the history of Africa since c. 1800. In this course, we’ll be learning about different models of colonialism and the power relationships which European rule produced. We’ll be engaging with nascent anti-colonial movements and ideologies, studying how African elites constructed their visions for the future. Finally, we’ll be grappling with the realities of post-colonialism, exploring just why those elites found it so difficult to realise their visions. The course provides students with a deep historical foundation for understanding why Africa is the way it is today, while providing more targeted opportunities for them to specialise in particular historical problems or geographical regions than interest them particularly. Students will read major works in African literature and learn to discuss their themes in depth. They will also have the opportunity to read some of the most exciting scholarship from Africanist scholars, including not only historians but also social and political scientists. The course also endeavours to reconstruct connections between Africa and the world outside, approaching African history in a global and transnational context. Students will learn not only about Nelson Mandela and Kwame Nkrumah, but about Fidel Castro’s ideological adventures in Africa, Frantz Fanon’s anti-colonial treatises, Live Aid, why Africa struggled to produce stable post-colonial states where East Asia succeeded, the global anti-apartheid movement, and much more. We will approach Africa as a part of world history – not apart from it.

Some of the classroom time will be devoted to orientation of students to the necessities and skills of elicitation; most of the classroom time will be devoted to elicitation from a speaker. A single language will be the focus of the elicitation. In addition to the classroom elicitation, each student will spend 10 hours outside of class eliciting from the language consultant. Students will prepare two research papers: one focusing on the phonlogy, one on some aspect of grammar. Students will learn how to elicit data and store it; part of how to analyze it and write it up they should already know, but their skills in all areas should be seriously enhanced and advanced by the work done in this course.

         Words like "force," "field," "radiation," "black hole" and "antimatter" are part of our culture; science fiction movies and popular science magazines use them all the time. What do these words really mean? How much of what we see in science fiction is based on real science and how much is pure fantasy? This course will emphasize the meanings of science terms and the way scientists really work, without getting bogged down in mathematics. Our goal will be to understand science terms and claims when we encounter them in fiction and the popular press. We will read several short stories and novels from the leading science fiction writers; we will also have in-class demonstrations of things like lasers, cryogenics, and electric fields. Students will be encouraged to bring in their own examples of science fiction literature that highlight some physics concept (or misconception) to share with the rest of the class.  Starting with Newtonian physics, this course surveys modern physics including Quantum Mechanics and Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Along the way, we will discuss whether travel to other stars is possible, conditions for the existence of life, and whether other "dimensions" exist. This course fulfills the Physical Science course requirement for School of Arts and Sciences students.

Traditionally it has been a center of religious pilgrimage, home to Israelite kings and Islamic caliphs. Today it is a cutting-edge urban center marked by stunning demographic diversity, a rapidly expanding economy, and an intractable political crisis. In this course, we will examine the history of the city-from its earliest days to today-with an eye toward its religious significance in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Special attention will be given to Jerusalem's changing urban fabric: its architecture, neighborhoods, natural resources, economy, and religious institutions.

         This course gives a broad introduction to classic and contemporary work on questions in metaphysics and epistemology. Central topics of concern will be the nature of reality and the possibility of knowledge.  Along the way we will discuss skeptical arguments to the effect that knowledge of certain aspects of reality is impossible and classic and contemporary responses to them. We will also discuss a number of topics in metaphysics, which may include the nature of the self, the existence of abstract objects, facts, and propositions, and debates between idealists and realists about the external world.

         The first year of university is one of a number of big changes we learn to negotiate in life. For many freshmen, the required composition course brings to awareness other significant challenges we have coped with in more or less unconscious ways. Moving away from home to a new city—perhaps for the first time ever—stirs up all sorts of deep, even archetypal, feelings and stories: separating from family; moving into the unfamiliar intellectual and residential environment of a large university; learning new ways of traveling, handling finances, taking care of oneself on one’s own; finding new cool friends who may or may not challenge our established ideas of who we are and where we come from; and starting a new life and lifestyle with a blank social slate.

         In this course, we will examine how the spiritual life—an inner dimension of life that has to do with our relationship with our own selves and/or the divine—is represented in writing while exploring the following inquiries: How do authors write about spiritual experiences/beliefs/questions/doubts that others cannot see? How do they push beyond religious rhetoric to convey their inner lives in language that others can understand? How can you write clearly and creatively about your own faith or skepticism? To investigate these questions and more, we will read critical and personal essays from writers of various religions, visit several religious landmarks in the city of Pittsburgh, and write a series of experimental yet disciplined essays designed to embody spirituality. This course welcomes students who want to use writing to explore their own spiritual lives and learn about the spiritual lives of others. Writing the Spiritual also includes an introduction to mindfulness meditation.

         “The Steel City,” “The City of Bridges,” “The City of Champions,” “The Paris of Appalachia,” and my personal favorite, “Hell with the Lid Off.” All have been names that refer to the city that many of you will call home for the next 4 years. To outsiders and perhaps locals as well, Pittsburgh can be a difficult city to navigate – geographically and rhetorically. Yes, we talk funny (Yinz’ll know what I mean soon enough), but as a city that somehow manages to simultaneously attract and resist every label that comes along, it also makes it a fun and challenging place to write about. In this course, we will deal with these challenges by exploring and writing critically about various representations of Pittsburgh through fiction, non-fiction, historical documents, photographs, and film. In addition to reading about the city, this course will require you to spend a significant amount of time exploring and critically analyzing its neighborhoods. Getting around the city is not unlike writing about the city: In the distance, you can see where you want to go, but often the roads are obscured by the hills, valleys, and rivers that divide it. Along the way, though, you may find something unexpected - a new perspective, a new idea, a new home - a new way of writing Pittsburgh.

         In this Freshman Seminar, we will focus on the popular science fiction trope of the “utopia” and its variants as a way to frame discussions on college level writing. Language use and writing have long been connected to utopias and dystopias: think of Orwell's 1984, Babylon in the Old Testament, or the young adult series, The Hunger Games. The Ancient Greek word "topos" has two meanings: a place where something is located and an undefined location where ideas for writing can be found. If utopian and dystopian can refer to both precise places and worlds where ideas come from, how might the concepts of utopias, atopias, and dystopias function as metaphors to help us understand our own writing? Along with writing essays, we will read the work of authors and thinkers like Ursula K. LeGuin, Kelly Link, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Philip K. Dick.

We will address such key questions as: What makes research feminist? How is feminist theory employed by the social sciences, humanities, and other disciplines? What role does a feminist researcher play?

         Basic economic theory is applied to issues involving the joint interaction of economic activity, the environment, and use of natural resources. The debate over the sustainability of economic development, the renewability and/or depletion of natural resources, and the effects of pollution on environmental quality will be surveyed, including the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Benefit-cost analysis, optimal tax and regulatory schemes, public goods, property rights, emission rights markets, and other economic policy instruments and concepts will be considered.

         What does mastering a language look like and how do human children do it so quickly while other animals never do? Moreover, how do we know what infants and young children know about language?  Students will learn about the process of language development and the methods used to study it, and then apply this knowledge to a lengthy hands-on research exercise.  After receiving training in the ethical treatment of participants and data, students will design a study procedure; collect, handle, and analyze data; and share results. Prerequisites: Research Methods, Developmental Psychology. NB: Students who have taken Psychology 1320 previously or who are taking Psychology 1320 concurrently will NOT receive credit for this course.

         Cynicism is an ancient philosophy of living that rejects conventional social values, especially those that involve money, power, and fame, in favor of alternative values that were believed to be more in harmony with a natural, virtuous way of life.  This is in marked contrast to the contemporary perception of cynicism as an attitude of pessimism, bitterness and distrust of human motives.  That characterization is too negative to reconcile with the original Cynic’s concern with living virtuous lives, not as social conformists but as social outsiders who developed and lived by their own moral standards.  This course is concerned with the modern conception of the Outsider, people and groups who choose to separate themselves, or are unwillingly separated, philosophically and ideologically from the society within which they live.  One of the most recognizable examples of living the life of the Outsider was embodied in the Beat Generation of the 1940’s and 1950’s, who embraced self-indulgence as well as literary themes of disenchantment and disengagement, including poet Allen Ginsburg (Howl), writer Jack Kerouac (On the Road, The Dharma Bums), and novelist William S. Burroughs (Naked Lunch), among others.  A second example is the counterculture of the 1960’s, the hippie generation, who tended to express themselves more in mass countercultural themes like student anti-war activism (Berkeley Free Speech Movement, Students for a Democratic Society – SDS, Kent State), or popular music, including cultural trend-setting rock (Motown, British Invasion, Classic Rock), socially activist music (Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Joan Baez), and film (Dr. Strangelove, Easy Rider, Woodstock).  Identity for both movements revolved around protest, more individual and artistic in the Beat Generation, more communal and media-oriented in the 1960’s counterculture.  In addition to these self-selecting Outsiders, other groups were forced into separation from mainstream American culture, like African-Americans, gay and lesbian Americans, and others.  They responded by developing their own countercultures.  Using mainly original sources, this course will examine the rhetoric of outsiders and the motivations that generated that inclination towards rebellion which characterized the countercultures of the 1950’s and 1960’s.  Requirements include:  discussion participation, 3 short papers (3 pages), 3 longer papers (8 pages), and one class presentation.

         Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

         Some metaphysical theories privilege polyadic relations as metaphysically prior to monadic properties while others privilege monadic properties as metaphysically prior to polyadic relations.  We see this in the metaphysics of physical quantities and in certain debates involving structuralism in philosophy of science, especially.  We will explore these debates as well as some very sobering questions like:  what makes a relation polyadic as opposed to monadic? Do relations come with “positions” built into them? How does a relation relate to its converse?

         No city has had a more enduring influence on the Western literary imagination than Rome. In the various phases of her evolution -- as the center of the greatest empire of the ancient world, the seat of the papacy, and the capital of the modern nation of Italy -- Rome has inspired many of the greatest works of Italian literature, broadly defined. In this course we will study the history of Rome and explore how the realities of Roman life have been reflected, interpreted, and satirized by writers and filmmakers from Antiquity through the 21st century. No prerequisites. This class will be conducted in English and does not require any knowledge of Italian.

         Charles Darwin’s ideas not only revolutionized biology - they also have revolutionary implications for how we see ourselves and our place in nature.  We will study the origins and development of Darwin’s ideas, and the reactions of the scientific, religious and philosophic community to them from Darwin’s time to our own.  The course revolves around two central questions: (1) What is the scientific status of Darwinism? (2) What are the implications of Darwinism for our beliefs about human nature?  We will spend the last few weeks of the term looking in detail at a variety of contemporary critics of Darwinism.

    Lausberg, Cynthia 

         The purpose of this course is to widen the student's understanding of human death, in its biological, socio-cultural, and primarily, psychological dimensions. We will examine the concept of death, psychological reactions to death and dying, and the process of bereavement. We will also explore selected issues such as suicide and –euthanasia, children's concepts of death, and the question of life after death. It is hoped that with increased knowledge about death and dying, you will be able to look more critically at materials being published in the popular press.

         This course explores the creative work of Latin American writers and artists who deal with representations of the environment from a variety of perspectives, personal approaches and national and social contexts. These representations are analyzed through short stories, novels, poetry, film, comic art, photography and performance. We will study how historical events like the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki of 1945, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986 shaped decisively the perception and representation of the environment. The emergence of a cultural imagination that reflects the utopian desire for a harmonious coexistence with the environment, while envisioning an apocalyptic future for the whole planet, is closely related to questions Latin American authors and artists raise about social conflicts, inequality, dictatorships and the exploitation of natural resources for the benefit of big corporations. We will focus not only on understanding basic concepts of ecocriticism and on how the environment is represented; we will also work in understanding how the texts or works of art are constructed and how they relate to more ample social and political issues.

    Novosel,Anthony Stephen 

         In 2012 when a former member of the Irish Republican Army and a former Ulster Volunteer Force prisoner met with University of Pittsburgh students in Belfast the opening of the conversation went like this: Ex-prisoners: You've been in Belfast for 2 weeks now and met with many people on both sides of the divide. Do you understand the conflict any better now? Pitt students: No. We are more confused now than when we got here. Ex-prisoners: Good! You've learned something. Contradictory? Confusing? Counter-intuitive? Nonsensical? Intriguing? All of the above? If you say, all of the above then you will find this class intriguing because what you will do is move beyond the easy and simple inherited histories that many people have of the modern conflict in Ireland. How will you do this? Well, to begin with you will do an in depth analysis of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the role they played in producing the two creation myths, one republican and one unionist/loyalist, that are still alive in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. This will set the stage for your examination of the Northern Ireland state between 1921-1969 and how the conditions created by that Protestant Parliament and a Protestant state led to the violence of 1969. The third stage of your studies focuses on the descent into violence of 1969-1972. In this stage, you will examine how groups and individuals made decisions that led to the horrible violence of this conflict. In the final stage of your analysis, you will examine the evolution of the Provisional IRA from a purely militarist force to, as some now argue, a moderate green political movement. At the same time, you examine the transformation of some loyalist paramilitaries from sectarian bigots and killers to social democrats and moderate political actors. By the end of this class, if not before, you will come to realize that history is rarely black and white and that there are many shades of grey. There are no formal prerequisites. Just bring a willingness to learn, to challenge your own beliefs (That does not mean you have to change them.) and to engage actively in the study of Ireland/Northern Ireland and the larger issue of sectarian conflict.

         How have computational devices affected the way we think about our own humanity? This course prepares students to critically examine the intersections between digital devices and human life. Covering topics such as the relationship between computers and humans, surveillance, big data, and interactivity and games, we question what it means to be human in a space of pervasive digitality. Assessment will be based on regular online posts, a midterm examination, a final curation project, and class participation, both digital and face-to-face. This course fills the Philosophy General Education requirement and meets three times per week: twice for lecture, once for recitation/lab.

Primary emphasis is on discrete systems, although continuous systems are also discussed. A major objective of the course is to familiarize the student with several important discrete simulation programming languages and to illustrate their uses in the modeling and simulation of various kinds of systems. Programming is carried out using CSIM. Topics include: systems characterization, classification, and model types; advantages and disadvantages of simulation studies; pertinence of probability and statistics to the representation of stochastic processes and non-deterministic behaviors in system models; different viewpoints and orientations in conducting system simulations; modeling tools and techniques used in selected simulation programming environments; validation and verification.

         We will approach this course as a workshop in its most elemental sense: a space where things—in our case stories—are produced or created. Unlike a typical writing class, where text is our primary material, in this digital studio-based course, we’ll explore how words can be combined with and interpreted through sounds and images to create rich multisensory narratives. Through a mix of discussion, workshops, and hands-on production, you’ll develop a set of tools and techniques for translating your writing to emerging digital genres—including photo/graphic, audio, and video forms—while considering how your encounters with these media might, in turn, inform or enrich your craft as a writer. This course is designed to accommodate students at every level, from the seasoned veteran to the terrified beginner. No previous experience with media production is expected or required.

In this course, we will look at these and other questions focused on politics and policies in the European Union.  In the first two parts of the course, we will look at voters, public opinion, and parties. We will study the relationship between voters and parties and the ‘European Project’ and how this is changing, reflecting current events in Europe and around the world and the rise of new parties and leaders.  In the third part of the course, students will work on a policy-focused project. We will finish off the semester discussing the challenges that the European Union faces moving forward in the 21st century.

         This course is designed as an overview of the history, teachings and rituals of the Orthodox Church in its multinational context. Geographically, Eastern Orthodox Christianity primarily includes Russia, south-eastern Europe and the coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, but there is also a large Orthodox diaspora in the western hemisphere. Understanding Orthodox Christianity -- its specific historical experience (from Byzantine and Ottoman empires to the life under communism, and beyond), its theological doctrines and spiritual practices, its rich artistic, musical and ritual expressions -- has become increasingly relevant in the post-communist era with the emergence of religion as an important aspect of cultural identity and national self-definition.

    Miller, Michael E.&nbsp;

         The Greeks in the sixth to fourth century B.C. initiated forms of thinking we have from then on called "scientific" and "philosophical". This course examines the question of how science is distinguished from "non-science" by studying the role of myth and science in ancient Greece. The aim is to understand what distinguishes the ideas of the first scientists and philosophers from the earlier beliefs called myth.

         General content, purposes and methods: The course centers on classic texts of world literature, from Homer, to the Koran, to Emerson and Woolf.   This course is meant for all students who have an intellectual interest in the complex resources of some of our shared traditions as well as a healthy curiosity about the history of our present. In other words, this seminar is intended to make available a demanding, but still selective encounter with works of high aesthetic, intellectual, and indeed even political importance.  We will conduct this course as a seminar using the Socratic Method.  Each class, one or two students will give an introduction to that day's reading in order to enable conversation and debate.  We will not rely on secondary materials, except in so far as they are essential to placing our authors and texts in their contexts.  In order to enrich this course as much as possible, we will arrange related events outside of class time.  These events might include showing films, arranging for expert visitors from our campus and other universities, and holding reading or discussion groups in the honors college facilities.

    Lovett,Matthew T 

         This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the core feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality.  In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach “theory” as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the practices that shape our everyday lives, rather than merely a collection of texts. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete organized written analyses that build on feminists who have come before us.

         The goal of this fifth-semester course is to enhance fluency and the development of oral proficiency in Spanish. Although the emphasis is on speaking and listening skills, reading and writing assignments are an important part of the syllabus. Certain grammar points are reviewed (ser/estar, preterite/imperfect, etc.), but communicative competence is not measured by grammatical competence alone. This course helps students to improve their fluency, pronunciation, and strategic competence such as paraphrasing skills, and increases their vocabulary through readings, films, digital recordings and other authentic materials. This course is offered every term, and counts toward the Spanish major.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

         Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

         This introductory course offers students opportunities to improve as writers by developing their understanding of how they and others use writing to interpret and share experience, affect behavior, and position themselves in the world. Although specific reading and writing assignments may vary from section to section, in all sections student writing will be the primary focus. As a step toward college-level critical literacy, this course is designed to help student writers become more engaged, imaginative, and disciplined composers, better equipped to handle complex subjects thoughtfully and to use sources responsibly. All sections will require at least one crafted composition per week as well as participation in class discussion about writing.

In short, they are to prepare proposals, formulate essay themes in both the English Senior Essay and the Chinese essay, determine other possible formats that can be accepted as supplements (audio-visual, electronic, etc.), as well as a timetable of when to do what. This project instructs students on how to find appropriate resources, seek advice from the faculty, and complete their projects in accordance with required standards

         This course offers students opportunities to compose essays using words, sound and moving images. Drawing upon their interest in, and knowledge of, the image, students learn to consider the relations between words and images, to sharpen their instincts as thinkers, storytellers and editors.  Working both individually and collaboratively, students are asked to consider the methods of other writers and filmmakers, and to try similar projects. Revision is a regular feature of the course and the production exercises stress collaboration. Students will work on-site at Pittsburgh Filmmakers in weekly lab sessions devoted to learning theory and technology, as well as experimenting with the composition of images.

    Horton,Zachary K 

         One way to characterize the intertwined social and technological milieu of the 21st century is as “scan culture.”  This will be the theme of this class.  From the NSA's wide reaching scanning programs revealed by Edward Snowden to be systematically scanning nearly all of our metadata to Gmail's scanning of our emails to ubiquitous body scanners at airports to the vast digitization efforts by Amazon, Google, and the Internet Archive to transfer our archives and reading practices into the modalities of the digital, our lives are largely structured by scanning techniques that are simultaneously technological and social. This course, offered alongside the launch of a larger initiative to investigate the cultural aspects of scanning, will take a multi-media approach to scan culture. We'll analyze novels, stories, films, video games, web sites, and technological systems in order to develop a critical vocabulary and conceptual framework for making sense of scanning as a form of culture. In addition, students will have the opportunity to join in the building of a book scanning system, to investigate “from the inside” the protocols, possibilities, and limitations of digitization.

We will read major works of postmodern literature in order to consider whether or not postmodernism can be understood in terms of literary aesthetics, as a movement, as a period, etc. We will also examine these works in relation to other important cultural discourses such as gender, race, and sexuality.

         The novel is the most recent major form of writing to emerge, a fruit of modernity, complexly responding both to the commerce of print and to the aesthetics of “literature” as a cultural category. This course aims to open conversation across a wide range of historical materials, both fascinating, powerful novels and provocative, influential works of theory and criticism about the novel as a form, extending over several centuries (since 1600) and diverse national cultures (including possibly African American, American, Brazilian, Colombian, English, French, German, Indian, Russian, Spanish, Turkish). Within English, it aims to engage MFA students as well as those pursuing Critical and Cultural Studies, and earlier versions of this course have also proved valuable for students in other literature departments, as well as some of the social sciences. Writing assignments will include weekly brief engagements with a chosen aspect of the assigned reading plus longer final work. The course encourages students to develop final projects—most likely essays, but possibly other forms—that address one or more novels or critical/theoretical works of the student’s own choice, in dialogue with the course assigned reading but not delimited by it. If you plan to take this course, please contact Professor Arac to make suggestions for works you would hope to find included, but no more than one novel from any national tradition.

    Carr,Stephen L 

         One of the unexpected byproducts of the proliferation of new media platforms is a renewed appreciation of the book as a richly complex medium for literary expression. A book is never simply a neutral container of literary content: it both constrains and enables literary practices.  This course will seek to develop an understanding of the book as a complicated material object, the product of specialized divisions of labor and diverse publishing practices of making, formatting, distributing, and selling physical copies of texts. There will be several hands-on exercises in making—and unmaking—books as well as directed research in Hillman Library’s Special Collections on the history of book production. We will investigate the relationship between the format of a book and various literary forms: how, for instance, does publication of a novel in serial numbers influence its style? And we will explore literary texts that play seriously with the book, including poetry by Blake and Dickinson, contemporary artist’s books, Danielewski’s House of Leaves, and some born-digital texts.

         Starting with J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, this course will identify the major conventions of modern fantasy and its subgenres, tracing their evolution from the 1950s into the twenty-first century.  We will focus on the figure of the Hero – both the traditional male archetype and the more recent and still largely undefined Female Hero.  In Tolkien’s work and in other readings such as Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games, Garth Nix’s Lirael, Neil Gaiman’s The Ocean at the End of the Lane, and J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, we will pay special attention to the forces of evil that the Hero must confront and to how these forces shape his or her journey.  As these forces are at work within and outside the hero, we will often look at evil as a metaphor for vexing political and social conditions in our own society relating to gender, race, class, and the duality of human nature.

         This course explores modes and effects of story and storytelling through the study of works in which the magical and/or scientifically unexplainable occur in diverse ways. Beginning in the early nineteenth century when Fantasy blossoms as a distinctive literary genre, we will identify its major conventions and trace the development of its sub-genres into the twentieth century and today, from Romance and Faerie Tale to High/Low Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Children's Literature, and Film.  We will also read criticism by key scholars in the field, which you will be expected to incorporate into your writing and class discussion. Our work will broadly take in the idea of "The Quest," not only in terms of a physical journey, but also as a search for knowledge, especially of the self. Fantasy operates as a collection of layered and multi-faceted metaphors, providing the writer (and reader) with the freedom to confront universal questions and contemporary problems of gender, class, science v. faith, and the dark side of human nature, among many others. We will pay special attention to studying the uses of Fantasy as a subversive art form by taking into account the "real-world" social, political, and creative contexts in which it is produced and read.

    Rogers,Gayle B 

         Modernism first flourished from about 1900 to 1945 in works by writers such as Conrad, Eliot, Joyce, Woolf, Pound, Stein, and Faulkner. Metropolitan modernist literature was influenced by rapid technological change, the increased visibility of war, interest in psychology and the irrational, and, most importantly, the changing relations between Britain and its colonies. We'll begin with a historical examination of the period, but Modernism is also understood as something *formally* new or experimental. The works are often difficult, emphasizing fragmentation, shifts in time and a self-conscious relation of present to past. Taking these cues, we'll examine the stakes in modernism's wish to tell a "new" story, and juxtapose its agenda to the realism against which it defines itself, thereby staging a dialogue between British and African, Caribbean, or Indian writers. We will also give some time to minority US writers.

The importance of geology in finding fossil fuels and economic minerals, as well as warning of potential natural disasters is emphasized. The effect on modern geologic thought of the latest concepts is introduced to enable the student to develop a feel for how modern science works.

         This course will teach students how to build products and services using lean methods.  This will be done by solving real-world military and intelligence community problems.  The course uses the lean launchpad platform for entrepreneurship.  This is a highly customer-centered hypothesis-test approach to developing a mission modes, and is particularly well-suited for technology startups.  It incorporates customer needs and user testing to build a minimum viable prototype.  At the conclusion of the course, students will be able to understand the problems/needs of searching for product-market fit; understand all the stakeholders, deployment issues, costs, resources, and ultimate mission value; deliver minimum viable products that match customer needs in an extremely short time; produce a repeatable model that can be used to launch other potential technology solutions.

         This course will offer an introduction to the critical study of games and gaming. From a theoretical overview of the roles that games play—enrolling us in certain logics and methodologies, structuring play and competition, opening up narrative possibilities and reinforcing particular ideologies—to an in-depth look at particular games, this course seeks to investigate the uses and potentials of gaming as a cultural form. We'll study and play many video games, from simple simulations to vast 3D open world games, from mainstream to indie, from the contemporary back to text adventure games. We will also, however, look at other forms of games: board games, games of chance, word games, etc. Interspersed throughout the class, we'll also consider other mediums that have influenced games or been influenced by them: literature, film, and the Web. Major recurring “streams” of the class will consider games and affect, games and ideology, games and narrative, the function of platforms, and gaming publics. No particular gaming experience or skill is required or expected. Just come ready to play!

         We tell ourselves stories in order to live." Joan Didion's formulation is central to this course. This course sets out to examine the ways in which the experiences usually posited as exclusive and opposite—“Literature” (imaginative) as opposed “Medicine” (theoretical/practical); writer/reader; medical treatise/literary text; writer/reader; physician/patient, for instance,  are in fact inseparably related, and to gain a sense of the centrality of narrative to both medicine and to literature; and to give students a sense of the bridges between what C.P. Snow has called “The Two Cultures” of Sciences/Humanities.

         The Renaissance in England, from about 1500-1660, is an age of vigorous creative engagement with the past - that of both classical Greece and Rome and of medieval Europe. It is also an era in which contact with the "New World," revolutions in religion and politics, and economic upheavals provoked an incredibly varied literary response. We will survey some of the richest examples of writing that made use of the past and struggled with the present, including the speculative fiction of Thomas More's Utopia, the raucous energy of Shakespeare's stage, the rich psychology of Mary Wroth's sonnets and Spenser's allegories, and the audacity of Milton's epic.

         We will explore selected plays by Shakespeare in relation to contemporary and early modern debates about gender and sexuality. How do the plays dramatize or question beliefs about femininity, masculinity, and desire? We will also discuss such topics as cross-dressing, gender fluidity, queer theory, and the intersections of gender with race and class. We will consider Shakespeare's plays together with controversial works by other Renaissance writers, female and male, as well as with more recent adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays in various media, from film to graphic novels.

         Violent conflict among organized groups has existed across millennia and empirical evidence suggests that the ability and willingness of humans to employ violence remains robust.  This course explores a particular class of organized violence, namely, militarized conflict among states. We examine alternative explanations for violent conflict and war in interstate relations and explore how well these explanations fare in light of empirical evidence.  We look at how factors such as geographic proximity, military alliances, historical rivalries, material capabilities, economic ties, domestic political systems, and membership in international organizations impinge on states’ decisions to engage in military violence.

         For many, the dramatic growth of the mass media has caused politics to become something of a spectator sport rather than an opportunity for direct personal involvement. New media now provide the critical linkage mechanism connecting government leaders and their constituents. Additionally, the citizen’s understanding of political phenomena increasingly is affected by the interpretations of social and political affairs offered by popular or non-news media. This course will examine the significance of media, with particular emphasis on media in the United States. We will consider what social scientists have discovered regarding the political implications of current media practices, what possibilities exist for media reform, and what long term consequences active media bring for the workings of democratic governance.

    Bonneau,Christopher W 

         The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the organization of courts (federal and state; both in the U.S. and in other countries), their role in our society, the processes through which judges act, and their impact on politics.  We will compare the reality of how judges behave to society’s beliefs and expectations about how they should behave.  We will also discuss the limits of what can and should be expected of courts and judges.  A central theme of this course will be to analyze judges as political players who have a profound influence on the development and implementation of public policy.

         Human beings like to explore the limits of experience and push against a boundary that separates what is known to be possible from what is commonly regarded as impossible. Can we live forever? Can we cure all diseases? Can we levitate? Can we talk to animals? Can we touch fire and not get burned?  Can we be in two or more places at the same time?  Can we travel through time? Can we turn lead into gold?  Can we expand our consciousness in order to experience transcendence? Can the strength of the body be enhanced by focusing the power of the mind?  In the history of human experience, Asia has been a cultural crucible for these and related questions that broadly encompass the magical possibility of embodied experience.  Taking a broad, comparative perspective on magic, but focusing on concrete examples of the supernatural body in India, Tibet and China, we will study these questions, looking at the way they have been asked, and at the social and cultural consequences of the answers people have given to them in different contexts.

         In this course we examine pottery from two perspectives: that of the people who made pots in the past and that of the archaeologists who seek to interpret pottery found at archaeological sites. The aim of this course is to engender a perspective on pottery that is based on real life experience with it.  Students will work through the process of producing the clay fabric, manufacturing pots, decorating them, and firing.  In the last section of the course, we analyze pottery produced in the class using archaeological techniques.  These include characterizing temper, cross-section analysis to determine manufacturing techniques and firing conditions. This course will lead to a better understanding of how pottery was produced in the past and of how the analysis of it will answer archaeological questions. Readings will focus on pottery manufacture and on archaeological approaches to the study of ceramics. A Special Fee of $20.00 to cover the cost of materials.

         This course will enable you to critically analyze consumer culture by introducing you to the theories social scientists most commonly use to study consumerism. We will begin by examining the rise of mass consumption in the late 19th century and its development during the twentieth century.  In diverse social contexts, we will explore various aspects of consumer culture including the role of advertising in shaping identities, the fate of high culture in a world ruled by commodities, the role of media in forging consumer behavior, and anti-consumerist movements. The special focus of this course will be on branding, which is a particular strategy in marketing. It proposes that consumers do not buy particular products but, instead, they buy particular brands. We will spend two weeks discussing how strategies of branding allow corporations to expand revenue opportunities and how practices of branding may empower or further marginalize consumers from socio-economic power.

         Undergraduate Seminar. Anthropology has inspired the intellectual imagination of a broad range of scholars who have, over the course of the past century and a half, tried to make sense of what makes us human by thinking critically and comparatively about the nature of culture and cultural difference.  In this course we will “think with” some of these scholars in order to understand the questions that have inspired them and how their answers to these questions have produced a way of inhabiting the world with a particular attitude of mind.

         This course is designed to provide an understanding of methodology and methodological approaches in anthropology, and to provide a basic mastery of several key methods and techniques used in anthropological research.  It will include a discussion of the nature of inquiry in anthropology;  the development and implementation of different kinds of designs to investigate a range of types of questions asked in anthropological research; issues of sampling and informant selection; ethical questions in anthropological research; and the appropriateness of specific designs, including both qualitative and quantitative designs for different theoretical approaches. Several key methods will be discussed and practiced, including:  participant observation; key informant interviewing; design of structured, semi-structured and informal interviewing guides and questionnaires; structured observation; life history interviewing; and the collection of oral history materials.   We will also explore several methods for the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data.  Students will be expected  to complete a practicum assignment  in which they will identify a research question, develop an appropriate design, use several methods to collect and analyze data to address the question, and write a report in the format of a journal article.

         This graduate seminar will explore aspects of warfare and physical conflict in the archaeological record (conquest, raiding, fortification, war-related sacrifice and captive-taking, etc.).  We will cover selected current issues in the anthropology of war and engage with a series of case studies from specific times and places.  Through course readings and discussion, we examine relationships between warfare and other forms of violence, political authority, social organization, and fields such as gender and the treatment of dead bodies.  Contemporary ethnographic writing on warfare serves as a possible source of analogy and a stimulant to thought.  The class is also centrally concerned with issues and problems in the archaeological interpretation of evidence for violence.

         This course will introduce you to the foundations of Human Behavioral Ecology as a research program, and will encourage lively debate of its merits, foibles, and flaws. Insights from this theoretical paradigm are relevant to the study of individuals and groups in all time periods, regions, and levels of cultural complexity. The introduction will be followed by a series of modules wherein students construct the basic models of HBE from scratch. Final projects will require application of original data (archaeological, observational, experimental, or creative derivations), and models in foraging ecology, territoriality, mate-choice, and exchange to both specific and general questions in anthropology and archaeology. By the end of this course you will have a solid understanding of what HBE is and isn’t, you will understand how the logic and models can be used to organize certain kinds of research, and in the process you will learn how to craft a more coherent and explicit research design.  Students will need regular access to a laptop computer, and a willingness to explore different approaches to manipulating quantitative software.

The following examples of ancient states are covered in the course:  Aztec, Teotihuacan, Toltec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Classic Maya, Post Classic Maya, Moche, Wari, Tiwanaku, Chimu, and Inka.  A special aim is to understand how Amerindian concepts about statecraft and rulership mesh with or diverge from general (cross-cultural) anthropological and other theories about ancient and modern states.

    De Montmollin,Olivier 

         This seminar examines theories and case studies from the field of ethnoarchaeology which lies at an intersection of social anthropology and archaeology. Ethnoarchaeologists study people and their record of material culture in the ethnographic present, with an archaeological interest in how past people might have produced their own material culture records (ranging widely from fetid rubbish to exquisite artworks). Ethnoarchaeology thereby provides useful information for building analogical models needed to infer past thoughts and behaviors from material remains in the archaeological record. Equally interesting and useful are the fresh and timely understandings which ethnoarchaeology offers about how recent people interact with their material world. With the focus on materiality in past and present, the seminar can engage the interest of archaeologists, social anthropologists, historians, art historians, sociologists, and other social scientists.

         This course is one in a series that focuses on environmental issues in southwestern Pennsylvania.  Forests are made up of trees. "Timber " is what they yell when the trees are cut and fall.  With maturing forests scraping the sky in Pennsylvania and other parts of the northeastern united states, and controversial restrictions on national forest timbering in the pacific northwest, there is tremendous pressure to cut the local hardwood forests.  But unlike the turn of the century when all of Penn's woods was clear-cut, there is a growing ethic that believes trees are more valuable growing than cut - for recreation and environmental reasons. This course on forest and parks issues is the fourth in a series that focuses on environmental and public policy issues in south western Pennsylvania.  Through newspaper articles, field trips and guest speakers, the course will explore the issues and conflicts that abound in our wildlands and urban woods. Emphasis is on a balanced presentation of the issues, discussions of various approaches to solving problems and development of writing skills through a number of short assignments based on readings and presentations of guest speakers."

         This course describes a number of topics related to mathematical biology. This year we will cover several areas of interest including pattern formation in reaction-diffusion and advection models with applications to immunology, chemotaxis, etc; evolutionary dynamics such as the evolution of cooperation, some game theory, and replicator dynamics; and some cell physiology modeling such as the cell cycle and simple circadian models.   The prerequisites are some simple differential equations, a bit of Fourier transforms, and some knowledge of software to numerically solve the various equations.

         This course will focus on the life cycle of adult close relationships (with an emphasis on romantic relationships), ranging from stages of initial attraction and relationship initiation to growth and maintenance of the relationship, and in some cases, dissolution. We will examine current theories and research in the social psychological study of close relationships to gain a better understanding of the basic processes involved in intimate relationships. Class meetings will employ a seminar format, consisting mainly of facilitated discussions and student-led presentations on topics such as attraction and first impressions, commitment and interdependence, relationship cognition, attachment, love and intimacy, communication, sexuality, conflict, relationship maintenance, and relationship dissolution. Students are expected to read and comment on papers, participate actively in class discussions, and complete written assignments as well as an oral presentation.

         This course will address a range of topics related to the theory and treatment of fear and anxiety.   The goal of this course is to introduce and discuss theoretical models for understanding and treating anxiety and related disorders.  We will explore fear and anxiety from several perspectives, including DSM-based and transdiagnostic approaches.  Readings will expose students to seminal works, current research methods and recent findings, and ongoing controversies in the field of anxiety and clinical psychology more broadly.  Throughout the course, students will learn to become educated consumers of scientific research, gain experience developing and presenting original research ideas, and design studies that can contribute to the scientific literature.

         Motor development is more than a list of norms on a growth chart.  Adaptive control of movement is a major developmental task, and the acquisition of new motor skills provides infants and young children with valuable opportunities for learning.  In this course, we will examine theory and research on motor development from infancy through childhood, focusing on behavioral aspects, such as movement patterns and developmental sequences, and underlying mechanisms related to change over time. Topics to be covered include movement in the fetal period; early motor behavior; the development of ballistic, object manipulation, and locomotor skills; links between motor advances and developments in perception, cognition, communication, and language; and developmental disabilities.

         This seminar is designed to achieve two main goals.  The first is to provide an overview of theory and research on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).  Topics to be covered include epidemiological and etiological issues; traditional and non-traditional theories of autism; attentional and perceptual processes, sensory atypicalities and repetitive/stereotyped activities; early social and communicative behavior, speech and language processes, play and imitation, socioemotional skills, and face processing; the neural bases of ASD; and early identification.  The second is to facilitate the development of analytical skills for evaluating, conducting, and presenting research on ASD.

         What are the most effective ways to learn and study, and do we recognize them as students—and if we do not, why not?  This course provides an introduction to how learners use and reason about their own memory and knowledge. We will discuss basic principles of human learning and memory before delving into how learners do (or do not) apply these principles in learning and education: Recognizing what we have and haven’t learned, deciding how and when to study, and judging what are effective ways to study. Finally, we will cover how these scientific principles and discoveries can be applied to education, technology, and the law.

         What does socioeconomic status have to do with our physical health? This Honors course addresses this question from biopsychological perspective. In doing so, an emphasis will be placed on specific aspects of physical health and health behaviors for which there are known socioeconomic inequalities. By the end of the course, students will be expected to have a deeper understanding of how biological psychologists (1) measure socioeconomic status, (2) conceptualize health inequalities, and (3) investigate the complex factors associated with socioeconomic Health inequalities. Students will also learn about intervention and policy approaches aimed at reducing socioeconomic health inequalities across the lifespan. Class meetings will consist of facilitated discussions and student-led presentations. Regular reaction papers to reading assignments and a final term paper are required.

         One of the unfortunate certainties of life is that we sometimes hurt people we care about, and they sometimes hurt us. Luckily, these conflict events do not have to be detrimental to our relationships. When managed well, conflicts can be functional and actually contribute to positive relationship outcomes. In this course, we examine research in the social psychological study of conflict resolution. Weekly readings will cover antecedents and consequences of conflict, barriers to conflict resolution, benefits and costs of various responses to conflict (e.g., forgiveness, revenge, apologies), and factors that predict constructive vs. destructive responses to conflict. Content will focus primarily on interpersonal conflict but unique considerations in intergroup conflict will also be covered. Students are expected to complete thought papers describing their reactions to research articles, participate actively in class discussions, give one oral presentation, and develop an independent research proposal on a topic of interest in the domain of conflict resolution.

         Sleep and circadian rhythms are in the news.  Reports in the lay press and best-selling books have linked sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances to almost any adverse health outcome you can think of including anxiety and depression, substance abuse and other risky behaviors, susceptibility to the common cold, accelerated aging, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality.  This seminar course will examine the evidence linking sleep and circadian rhythms to health, including important epidemiological and experimental studies.  We will also examine putative biological, behavioral, and social mechanisms through which sleep and circadian rhythms affect and are affected by health and disease.  This seminar course is appropriate for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in psychology, neuroscience, public health, nursing, bioengineering or other departments/schools at PITT, CMU, and other local universities with reciprocity agreements with PITT.  Advanced undergraduates may also be eligible for this course, with advance permissions from Drs. Roecklein and Hall.

The initial focus is on the epidemiology of childhood disorders and issues in their diagnosis and classification, including strengths and weaknesses of current diagnostic classification systems. We will next consider specific disorders and examine what is known about their developmental course and outcome, family and other risk factors or correlates, neurobiology, co-occurrence with other disorders, and logical targets for prevention and/or treatment. These disorders include child and adolescent depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, child anxiety disorders, PTSD, OCD, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Some attention will also be given to related issues, such as suicide and self-injurious behavior.

The course also provides sociolinguistics and socio-cultural information especially when language is intimately linked with culture. Recitation classes will provide the students opportunity to practice strictly in Korean with various tasks and activities in most essential daily life situation. This means that students are expected to use the target language as much as they can throughout the course. Students will often be asked to make a pair or a small group in which they may interact with each other verbally. Students are expected to memorize the frame dialogues, vocabularies and expressions assigned by lesson with the help of CD-ROM in the Language Media Center (G17 CL) or on-line web site of the textbook and the workbook

Beyond this conceptual and empirical examination of sexism and racism as oppressive paradigms, we will struggle also with application of "truth" and "justice" standards in rounding out our informed and critical examination of sexism and racism (e.g., To what extent are truth and justice burdened by stereotypes?  Are there corresponding implications for our national and global economy?  For our social well-being as a nation?  For our ability to "sell" our product of democratic capitalism to other nation states?)

         Modern Chinese literature has been instrumental in fostering revolutionary and enlightenment objectives and reflecting and shaping social reality. Therefore it has always been taken as an essential window through which to understand Chinese political and social history. However, despite the close link between literature and politics, literature always reveals its ever-lasting aesthetic value that transcends the specific historical and political contexts. To appreciate both literature and its relationship with modern Chinese history, this course focuses on the canonical works in 20th century China. We will read influential fiction by modern and contemporary writers such as Lu Xun, Ba Jin, and Eileen Chang. Nobel laureates Gao Xingjian and Mo Yan’s novels will also be dealt with. In addition, Taiwan writer Wang Wenxing’s novel Family Catastrophe will shed some light on contemporary society and the literary field in Taiwan.

         Helen of Troy, Sappho, Pericles' lover Aspasia, and Cleopatra, Achilles, Pericles himself, Plato, and Alexander the Great. These are names familiar to many of us, but to what extent was these individuals' gender an element of their achievement and fame? This course attempts to answer this question by examining the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations from the perspective of male and female. We shall proceed by topic, focusing on legal status and citizenship, marriage, the family, the citizen life course, public roles, education, sexuality, religion, popular attitudes, and the views and conceptualizations of ancient social and political theory. Throughout we shall isolate and discuss factors determining or conditioning the peculiar features of the gender roles before us and especially those that seemed to have prompted departures from the prevailing norms. Readings will include a historical narrative, a reader of excerpts from primary sources arranged by topic, and a selection of Athenian comedies and tragedies. The course material will be illustrated by films.

         Beginning as a small farming settlement situated alongside the Tiber river, Rome rose to become one of the greatest civilizations in human history, which spread its influence over much of the western world. In addition to careful investigation into the social, political, military, and economic organization of Rome as it developed from a monarchy through a republic and into an empire, the class will examine the art, architecture, literature, religion, culture, and daily life of the city across the spectrum of social classes. The class will utilize the large body of surviving Roman literature, including histories, poetry, and personal letters (in translation), as well as visual aids, such as slides and films, to create a living picture of whom the Romans were. Class time will be used for lectures as well as student lead discussion.

         The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrence that provokes a variety of human responses. In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death.

         This undergraduate survey introduces students to current themes and approaches in the archaeology of the Greco-Roman world. The class begins with an overview of the history and methods of archaeology. The focus then shifts to thematic treatments of key subjects in classical archaeology, such as rural and urban landscapes, the material remains of ritual and cultic activity, domestic assemblages, and the ways in which politics, expressions of identity, and cultural exchange have shaped the material culture of the ancient Mediterranean region. The course concludes with a discussion of the reception of classical antiquity in our own society, and special emphasis is placed on the ways in which modern biases impact interpretations of the past.

         What are the social costs of war? Is it right to violate an unjust law? What obligations do the living owe the dead? Can a fallen enemy be forgiven? What is the truest measure of a great leader? These are among the burning questions of Greek Tragedy, one of the most widely-read and influential of all ancient literary genres. But how have these plays retained their relevance and power for nearly three millennia? Who have been their most important readers, translators, and critics, and what lessons have they sought to draw? This course offers an introduction to the reception of Greek Tragedy in twentieth and twenty-first century literature and thought. Each semester, we examine the modern reception history of Greek tragic dramas by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and/or Euripides. Although these plays were originally written and performed in the last half of the fifth-century B.C., they each have a unique post-Classical history, invoking profound messages and teaching powerful lessons at times of political and social instability around the globe.

         The poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus (ca. 84 BC – 54 BC) continues to enjoy tremendous popularity. His short lyric poems and epigrams in the elegiac meter are charged with a sense of intimacy, intensity and immediacy that draw readers into a world of tumultuous emotional experience. His longer, non-lyric poetry explores complex themes of identity, personal and family relationships, the ethos of the heroic age and the art of translation, among others. We will read, analyze and discuss as much of Catullus's poetry as we can during the term. Our goals are: to gain an historical appreciation of Catullus's Latin within the traditions of Latin poetic diction; to master the poet's metrical forms; and to engage with the scholarly interpretation of his poetry.

Besides this novel, which relies heavily on folklore, social satire, and traditional farce techniques, we will examine works written by Romantic authors Manuel Antônio de Almeida and José de Alencar, whose "foundational fictions" revolved around such topics as class, race, indianismo, and Brazilian history. Students will also read novels authored by the Naturalist writer Aluísio Azevedo and the realist Machado de Assis. Considerable attention will be paid to the question of brasilidade ("Brazilianness"), particularly as it is formulated in the novels and essays of Alencar and Machado. Requirements:

         In “The Age of the World Picture” -- his essay written after World War II – Martin Heidegger argues that in the age of modern technology, the world has become a “world picture,” such that understanding, knowing, and conceiving the world is an act inseparable from seeing, picturing, and viewing the world. In modernity, the process of visual objectification that converts the world into a visual object (a “picture,” an “exhibition,” or “target”) becomes the epistemological basis of knowledge, representation, and even subjectivity. Supplementing Heidegger’s argument, scholars such as Timothy Mitchell (“the world as an exhibition) and Rey Chow (“the age of the world target”) have pointed out that this politics of vision is intimately connected to a Western colonial/imperial epistemology (e.g. Orientalism, the coloniality of power), that relies on and constructs a set of naturalized spatial structures through which the knowledge of the world is ordered. The intimate relations between visuality and space provide the premise of this course that explores the ways in which borders – as that which attempt to distinguish, separate, define or even connect one space from another – are visualized, imagined and narrated in contemporary Latin American cinema. The concept of borderscapes, which we will utilize in this course, points to a double paradox of contemporary life: the increased policing of immigration and human movement along local/national/regional borders while goods and information flow across borders quite freely; and the hardening of ethnic, racial, class and gender boundaries, at a time when discourses of multiculturalism and diversity are highly disseminated and celebrated. Taking seriously this notion of borderscapes that acknowledges the dynamic, mobile, relational and heterogenous nature of borders produced by the complex movements of global capitalism and migration, we will examine the ways in which visuality and visual media produce, interrupt and articulate borders. How do contemporary Latin American films visually negotiate the contradictions and multiple spatializations presented by borderscapes? What strategies, interventions, and epistemologies does contemporary Latin American cinema offer? We will address these questions by analyzing several Latin American films from various nations and productions that include Carlos Reygadas’s Japón (2002), Rodrigo Plá’s La zona (2007), Alex Rivera’s Sleep Dealer (2008), Lucrecia Martel’s La mujer sin cabeza (2008), Martín Tsu’s La salada (2014), Fellipe Gamarano Barbosa’s Casa Grande (2014), and Jayro Bustamente’s Ixcanul (2015). Theoretical and critical texts will be culled from Doreen Massey, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Paul Virilio, Sandro Mezzadra and Brett Neilsen, Rey Chow, Lisa Marie Cacho, Walter Mignolo and Nicholas De Genova.

         Decolonial Performance is a graduate seminar on theatre and performance artists who wrestle with the legacies of colonialism. The seminar studies theatre manifestos, plays, digital media, documentary films, and performance art by Latin American, Caribbean, Latina/o, and Native American artists. It focuses on contemporary feminist and queer aesthetic practices that highlight the insidious imprints and lasting effects of the early colonial period. For example, performances like James Luna¹s Artifact Piece (1986), where the Luiseño and Mexican American artist was exhibited in a museum glass case as a relic of Indian pasts, seek to alter colonial and postcolonial formations of race, desire, and freedom by rehearsing the colonial subjection of indigenous people in the Americas.

         In this course a close study of the works of Niccolò Machiavelli will serve as a point of entry for an interdisciplinary exploration of Renaissance Italy from the late fifteenth to early sixteenth centuries. We will study Machiavelli's contributions to numerous fields -- political theory, historiography, theater, epistolography, linguistics, etc. -- in relation to those of his major contemporaries, including Francesco Guicciardini. Students will gain a deep understanding of Machiavelli's radically innovative ideas, the cultural and political context that shaped his works, and the violent controversies that they provoked. Prerequisite: Graduate standing; advanced undergraduates may be admitted with permission from the instructor. Students from other departments and programs are welcome. Readings and assignments can be adapted to meet the research agendas of students working in other European cultural traditions and having little or no knowledge of the Italian language.

         In this “Italian Theatrical Workshop” the students, under the instructor’s supervision, and working both individually and in groups, will engage in a variety of different and yet closely related and interdependent activities: oral reading, storytelling, role-playing, improvisation, the creation and enactment of their own dialogues and scenarios, the close reading, study, interpretation and performance of pre-existing theatrical texts, and the adaptation to a script and performance of narrative pieces.  A sample of the best products of our activities during the semester will become the program for a final public recital which will be publicized in all Italian classes. Grading is based on participation in the class and recitation activities, written assignments, portfolio and final recital. Prerequisite: Italian 0060, 0061, or completion of Italian 0004 with B+ or better. A weekly 50-min, 0-credit recitation will be conducted by the course instructor. Students enrolled in the course must also be enrolled in the recitation. This course satisfies the Intensive Writing, Arts and Creative Expression General Education requirements.

         Freed from the more rigid rhetorical parameters of the past, the ‘letter’ begins to satisfy – in 18th century Europe – an extraordinary variety of functions: besides continuing to allow remote communication between people, and to be a fundamental vehicle of information and cultural exchange, it becomes the preferred form to give to one’s travel accounts, literary criticism, socio-political commentary and moral or philosophical musing. It is used to celebrate great, historical events as well as to chronicle daily domestic ones; it is employed as a narrative, fictional device, as well as a basic exercise to boost students’ linguistic and compositional skills. The course wants to address 18th-century letter-writing trends from an Italian stand point. Authors whose letters we will study include: Pietro Metastasio, Carlo Goldoni, Giuseppe Baretti, Pietro e Alessandro Verri, Vittorio Alfieri, Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi e Ugo Foscolo. Prerequisite: graduate standing in Italian or permission of the instructor. Undergraduate seniors majoring in Italian and graduate students of other disciplines with reasonable listening comprehension and reading knowledge of Italian are welcome (the latter will be allowed to do their presentations and complete their term papers in English).

    Pettersen, David A 

         When working on modern and contemporary periods, it is easy to take the materiality of a text or media object for granted. We think we know how a codex, a film, or a photographic image works because at first glance they might seem not all that different from the increasingly digital media objects that surround us today. But is this really the case, especially when the ubiquity of screens and the omnipresence of scrolling are fundamentally changing how we interact with moving images, still images, and written texts? How does the materiality of a given medium constrain and shape the kinds of meanings and experiences that texts and objects create? How have technological developments changed our sense of what literature and art were and are? In order to make visible and interrogate the various material supports of French cultural production in the 20th and 21st centuries, we’ll investigate several French and Francophone writers and artists that work at the borders of different media and create objects and texts that are difficult to categorize. Our objects of study will include graphic poetry, surrealist collages, photo novels, imaginary museums, cine-poems, bandes dessinées, adaptations, digital literature, and video games as well as more conventional novels and films that seek to reference and integrate other media. The possible writers, filmmakers, and artists that we will study include Guillaume Apollinaire, Louis Aragon, Sophie Calle, Chloé Delaume, Max Ernst, Jean-Luc Godard, Max Jeanne, André Malraux, Chris Marker, David Prudhomme, Pascal Quignard, and Marjane Satrapi. Our theoretical and secondary readings will draw on work in literary theory, media studies, and art history, including essays by Jean Baudrillard, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Michel de Certeau, Georges Didi-Huberman, Gérard Genette, Julia Kristeva, W.J.T. Mitchell, Jacques Rancière, and Paul Virilio. This course will be taught in French, and the readings will be primarily in French with some secondary readings in English.

         Caribbean literature has long depicted ecological degradation as a direct legacy of colonialism and imperialism. To support this claim, one only has to turn to Edouard Glissant’s Poétique de la relation (1990). In developing a theory of an “esthétique de la terre [aesthetics of the earth],” Glissant cites in epigraph two foundational poetic expressions of the twentieth-century Caribbean: Kamau Brathwaite’s “the unity is submarine” and Derek Walcott’s “the sea is history,” both of which give voice to the intertwining history of the slave trade and environmental dispossession. In the francophone Caribbean, the precursor to the archipelagic, relational thought of Glissant is Aimé Césaire, whose seminal Cahier d’un retour au pays natal (1939) contemplates the journey back to Martinique by bearing witness to the colonial devastation of the island’s ecology.

It will include presentation and practice of finer aspects of French grammar that are traditionally taught only at the advanced level and that enable students to achieve a more polished writing style. Students will also refine their writing skills and knowledge of French stylistic features through the preparation and writing of short translations (1/2-1 page) from French into English and somewhat longer (1-4 pages) essays in French.

         Considered alongside poetry and painting, to be a major art form,  the French bande dessinée (graphic novel or comic book) has a large, diverse readership. Moving from a study of the histories of the genre – one strand of which includes American pop culture – to the consideration of contemporary publications, this course will focus on the aesthetics of the image, and discussions of the way the novels mediate the reality that they address through image and text. Students enrolled in this course should be prepared to both experiment with drawing and write in French regularly. No prior illustration experience is required. The reading list will include texts by Goscinny (Le tour de Gaule), Mathieu, Marc-Antoine (L’origine), and Riyad Sattouf (L’arabe du  future 1).

         Through a comparative study of outstanding Japanese literary works and their screen adaptations this course investigates how literature and film treat some major ideological and socio-cultural issues in Japanese society: changes in marriage and family patterns; women’s roles; experience with war and occupation; and the loss of an individual identity. Among important questions to be posed are: What are the differences and similarities in the way the original and its film adaptation approach a particular issue? In transforming the original into film, how does each director follow, modify or alter the writer’s social, philosophical and/or ideological vision(s)? Readings consist mainly of pre-modern tales, modern fiction and contemporary novels which make up the rich heritage of Japanese literary tradition. Their film adaptations selected for presentation also represent the best of Japan’s postwar cinematic tradition. The student will gain valuable exposure to major aspects of Japanese society and culture as reflected in literature and film. This experience will also give him or her an appreciation of unique and universal attributes of these films and literary works. This course is particularly designed for the student interested in broadening his/her knowledge of Japanese society, culture and intellectual currents seen through film and literature as well as the student who wishes to compare other literatures/cinemas he/she has studied with those of Japan.

         What are some of the underlying assumptions of a modern scientific perspective? How is nature constructed by science? Is the thing we call science a system of immutable laws, something which is universal and irrefutable? Or is science rather a way of thinking, a form of culture, and more along the lines of a world view? In other words what are the mythologies of science? Moreover what are its effects on the world? For example how has modernization affected people? How does a scientific way of knowing the world affect society and the human condition? What is the meaning of modernity, and how is this connected with revolutions in science and technology? Also when is science inconvenient?

         This is an advanced undergraduate course in feminist economic sociology. We will use concepts, theoretical frameworks, and empirical research to interrogate “gender at work” in two main ways. (1) We will investigate how forces and institutions of political economy (markets, technologies and social relations of production, divisions of labor, etc.) produce and reproduce gender (that is, both difference and dominance organized around masculinity and femininity as natural “opposites”). (2) We will investigate how gender (assumptions and practices of gender polarization, biological essentialism, and androcentrism) organizes economic behavior, organizations, and institutions. The course will be organized in seminar format, with readings and participatory discussions and presentations of material directed toward students’ understanding and critically appreciating the research literature on gender and work.

         This course will sample idiosyncratically from the post-classical theoretical tradition. The primary vectors of inquiry will include: “neo-” theories in class analysis (Marxist, Weberian, Durkheimian), the Frankfurt school, social constructionism, practice theory, and theories of culture and representation. In line with the substantive focus of the sociology department, we will also attend closely to issues of social inequality, especially class, race, gender, and sexuality as principles of social organization of identities and institutions.

         Modern observational astronomy relies heavily on advanced techniques for image and spectrum analysis and the ability to deal with large datasets from surveys.  The principal aim of the course will be to provide practical experience with working with state-of-the art survey and multiwavelength datasets (e.g. SDSS, HST, and Spitzer data).  It will address problems in image acquisition and enhancement and will cover topics such as data analysis techniques, interfacing with survey datasets, statistical techniques, and experiment design. Some prior knowledge of astronomy will be helpful but will not be required; however, students should have some prior experience with computer programming (language does not matter).

         This course presents the conceptual basis of introductory classical physics. As such, this course covers the same general topics as PHYS 0110. The emphasis of this course, however, is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles of physics, with a reduced emphasis on mathematics than would be used in PHYS 0110. This course is intended for non-science majors and for students from the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. The mathematical level of this course will not be adequate for those students who plan to apply to Medical School. It could be used for those students as a preparatory course prior to tackling the more mathematically rigorous PHYS 0110 or PHYS 0174. In that case credit would not be given for both this course and either PHYS 0110 of 0174. Topics covered include: kinematics, Newton's Laws of Motion; conservation of total mechanical energy, total linear momentum, and total angular momentum; rotational kinematics and dynamics; simple harmonic motion; behavior of fluids; heat and heat transfer; mechanical waves and sounds.

The topics explored in this course include: human proportions, human motion, strength and balance, blood circulation, body temperature regulation. At the end of this course the successful student will be able to correctly apply physics principles to the human body, as well as show a moderate competence in modeling complex situations. Students are expected to be equipped with basic algebra and geometry, and will learn other mathematical tools as needed. PHYS 0110 is a co-requisite. Any student who has taken PHYS 0174 is also permitted to enroll. Students considering a major in Biology or the medical fields are encouraged to take this course.

         When is religion good for the environment? When is it not? In this course, students will become acquainted with how religious traditions throughout the world have addressed specific ecological problems. They will explore ways in which religious institutions are an important organizational hub in struggles for environmental justice. They will compare the structural features shared by environmentalism and religiosity, both of which are interested in making meaning of the world by appealing to an ultimate authority, such as God or Nature; and in forming identities and building communities by promoting guidelines, norms, and ritualized behaviors. The very construction of Nature as a concept, and its reverence in the context of the sustainability movement, can be informed by theoretical discourse from the field of Religious Studies. After a survey of approaches to the natural world in major religious traditions, students will focus on themes such as garden spiritualties, gendered Nature reverence, and eco-justice. They will also acquire the skills to assess the scripturally inspired indifference-or even antagonism-to environmental science, and the long shadow it has cast on the global economy.

         Energy pervades our lives, influencing our transportation, industry, agriculture, and building use. Climate change, national security, resource depletion, air and water quality, biodiversity loss, and other challenges demand new technological and social approaches related to energy, including broader public understanding and engagement. In 2012 the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and National Academy of Engineering (NAE) chose Pittsburgh as the pilot city for its Science and Engineering Ambassadors program to select, prepare, and support local experts. These experts provided the perspective of science and engineering to help community members make energy choices in their personal and professional lives. This course brings together prior NAS/NAE Ambassadors and staff, CMU and Pitt students and faculty, and citizens across generations for a series of events on energy topics. Students will review background literature on the energy landscape, read scholarship on energy issues of local concern, and collaborate with partners on public events to communicate energy issues. Through their work, students will increase their own understanding of and ability to engage publicly with energy issues, as well as contribute to the welfare of our local community. Discussions of technical issues enable students without advanced backgrounds in the engineering and the natural sciences to participate fully; students from all disciplines, especially the social sciences and humanities, are welcome to join this interdisciplinary course. NOTE: The course is scheduled on Tuesday and Thursday evenings for 2-1/2 hours. We will meet approximately half of those times. This allows us to respect the academic calendars of both universities, and provides flexibility in scheduling collaborative and independent student work.

         This laboratory course complements BIOSC 1250 Human Physiology.  Students will spend the first half of the semester developing their skills by measuring homeostatic parameters of the human body (blood pressure, blood chemistry, muscle response, etc).  They will then use that knowledge to design and perform experiments modeled after conditions of both eustress (exercise) and distress (disease).  In addition to weekly assignments, students will be required to present the results of their research projects.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.

        PREQ: (BIOSC 0060 or 0067 or 0068 or 0191 or 0080) or (BIOL 0102 or 0121); CREQ: (BIOSC 1250 or 1070 or 1080) or (NROSC 1070 or 1250); Min Grade C for all; PLAN: Biological Sciences or Bioinformatics of Ecology and Evolution or Microbio or Molecular Bio

         This laboratory course complements BIOSC 1250 Human Physiology.  Students will spend the first half of the semester developing their skills by measuring homeostatic parameters of the human body (blood pressure, blood chemistry, muscle response, etc).  They will then use that knowledge to design and perform experiments modeled after conditions of both eustress (exercise) and distress (disease).  In addition to weekly assignments, students will be required to present the results of their research projects.  There is a lab fee attached to this course.

         TURKISH CULTURE & SOCIETY -- This course is an introduction to contemporary Turkish culture and society.  Drawing on case studies from literature, film, music, print and social media sources, students will examine major issues and trends that are relevant to everyday experiences of people in Turkey. Topics may include  ideological currents like secularism, Islamism, Kemalism and nationalism, social construction of gender roles, civil society movements like ‘Gezi protests,’ literary figures like  Orhan Pamuk, Elif Şafak, Yaşar Kemal, Nazım Hikmet and Rumi, concepts of happiness in Turkish cinema and literature, musical genres and culinary traditions, holidays and celebrations, Turkey’s relations with the European Union, the Middle East, the USA and Turkish perceptions of ‘the West’. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will explore different points of views and perspectives on these topics through critical thinking, debate and discussion in class. The main learning objective is for students to deconstruct several aspects of Turkish culture and society, and to better understand the diverse and layered existence of people and their experiences in Turkey.  The course will be conducted in English.

         SWEDEN: FROM VIKINGS TO NOW -- Sweden – land of the Vikings, IKEA and midnight sun… But what is modern day Sweden really like? How did it change from a traditionally homogeneous country into the multi-cultural society it is now? In this course you will gain a deeper insight into how Sweden became the country it is today, what Swedish culture is and how it is changing. After a historical overview, we will look at areas like marriage and family, politics, religion, holidays and customs to try to grasp the hidden elements of Swedish culture that form society and the national identity. We will analyze characteristics usually associated with Sweden – fairness, self-sufficiency, egalitarianism and democracy, gender equality – and compare how these values differ from other cultures.

         On the basis of new findings and new ideas from several branches of biology, the course explores the view that there is a need to construct an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES) that goes beyond the current neo-Darwinian model of evolution, which is based on the Evolutionary Synthesis (ES) forged during the first half of the 20th century. Starting with a historical review of the current, generally accepted view of evolutionary theory, we will survey recent ideas and studies on developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance (i.e., genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbol-based inheritance), niche construction, and the Tree of Life. On the basis of these studies we will follow the ways in which they extend and modify our assumptions about the nature of heredity, development, and individuality. We will then examine the effects of these discoveries and ideas on the present version of evolutionary theory, and discuss their implications: Is the change in evolutionary theory a within-paradigm change or does it require a paradigm shift? What can the nature of current debates about this question tell us about the sociology and philosophy of biology?

         Quantum mechanics is rightly heralded as one of the great successes of 20th century physics, and provides the framework for our best contemporary theories of matter and radiation. However, almost a century after its birth, it remains unclear how we ought to understand what the theory is telling us about the world. This course will be an advanced introduction to the conceptual problems that beset the theory and selected proposals for addressing them. Topics discussed will include (i) the problem of measurement, its main proposed solutions, and the role of decoherence; (ii) Bell-type theorems, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and the status of locality in quantum mechanics; (iii) and (if time allows) either topics at the interface of quantum and classical mechanics, or the conceptual motivation for moving beyond quantum mechanics to quantum field theory. No prior familiarity with quantum mechanics is required; all relevant background material will be introduced in class. However, the amount of mathematics required for a responsible discussion of the material is non-zero, and students will be expected to acquire the technical tools necessary for informed discussion.

         Observation and Experimentation have long been taken as central to the legitimacy of scientific claims.  Richard Feynman wrote “The test of all knowledge is experiment.  Experiment is the sole judge of scientific ‘truth’” (1963).  But how do experiments reveal the way nature is organized? In this course we will explore a range of topics in the philosophy of experiment, including underdetermination and theory-ladenness, replicability, techniques and norms of experimental practice, the relationship between experimentation, theorizing and model-building and the new challenges of digitization and big data.

         This seminar intends to introduce students to Freud’s work. We will concentrate on Freud’s theory, rather than the practice of psycho analysis. I will argue that Freud’s theory of intentional human behavior and the crucial role of emotion or affect is basically correct and needs to be taken into account by any theory of human motivation. Perhaps his attempt to forge explanatory psychological categories was not as perspicacious as one might have hoped, but –I shall argue—they still function fairly well (pace many of his critics).  We shall critically analyze some work that has been quite critical of Freud and some supportive.  But the majority of time will be spent reading and coming to know the Freud corpus, and to a small extent some attempts to apply Freudian theory in other areas.

Such understanding can only be gained by bringing together several disciplines in an interdisciplinary manner. Thus, we will examine issues about race and racism that arise from biology, history, philosophy, and psychology. Non-philosophers are welcome. Students with training and expertise in related areas outside of philosophy are strongly encouraged to attend. Prior acquaintance with the philosophy of race is not presupposed.

Surprisingly, modern science answers yes to all these questions.  This course provides simple-to-understand explanations of these and other related questions, their broader philosophical significance and their histories.  The course is suitable for students with no science background but with an interest in the world of modern science.

         This course will expose students to the methodology and practice of experimental economics, where economic theories and hypotheses are tested and evaluated using data collected from controlled experiments. We will read and discuss a variety of different experiments that have been conducted including those examining markets and auctions, strategic interactions (game theory), individual decision making, political institutions and more. Students will be expected to critically evaluate experimental papers and to propose a new experimental design of their own that addresses an interesting social science question.

         The gap between rich and poor countries has increased dramatically in the postwar period. Between 1960 and 2000, per capita income in the poorest countries has remained stagnant, while per capita income for the 5 or 10 richest countries has been multiplied by a factor of around 3. For instance, per capita income in the United States was around 70 times higher than in Tanzania in 2000. Understanding the sources of such wide cross-country income inequality is an essential task in modern economics. This class explores frontier research on economic growth and development. Topics include: technology adoption, human capital, fertility, disease, legal institutions, urbanization, trade and growth, agricultural development, sectoral productivity, financial development, and provision of infrastructure. By the end of the class, students are expected to submit a research project in one of these topics.

         This course will provide the student with a solid understanding of macroeconomic theory and ensure that the student can apply macroeconomic analysis to the study of economic problems. The course covers the development of modern macroeconomic theory, including classical, Keynesian, monetarist and new classical views of the macroeconomy. Key areas to be covered include theories of business cycles, employment, inflation, economic growth and macroeconomic policy. Particular attention will be given to the role of money in general and monetary policy in particular. Considerable emphasis will be placed on analysing the strengths and weaknesses of these models and understanding how they differ. Students are required to have successfully completed introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics courses before enrolling on this course. Knowledge of elementary calculus is required.

         What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework.

         How and why did sex and sexuality become subjects of study?  How are our experiences of sex and sexuality shaped by a history of "scientific" explorations of desire? Why has sexuality become so central to our understanding of identity? What was sex like before "sexuality" was invented? This seminar explores these questions by approaching sex and sexuality as socially, historically, and culturally contingent concepts. We will consider sex and sexuality as they relate to other categories of identity, including race, class, ethnicity, nation, and ability.  Our theoretical and historical investigations will create the groundwork for understanding and rethinking how sexuality is understood in culture today. Topics treated will include "sodomitical sin," "inversion," the "intermediate sex," sex ed in schools, the Kinsey report, sex work, AIDS, and the history of pornography.

It will then consider how and why we act, and further, how we should act in light of what, as feminists, we know and value. Of concern will be the notions of acting and agency. Moreover, consideration of the ‘we’ in these questions and the accounts evaluated will require analysis to reveal implicit epistemological and value commitments. This course, like all of life, will thus consider knowledge and values and how to act in light of both. As a broad overview of feminist theory, the course will include classic works and topics in feminist epistemology (theory of knowledge) and feminist theory / feminism (feminism’s value commitments, as well as its approaches and calls to action).

         This course will center on recent research concerning visual rhetoric with attention to social differences, especially gender, sex, and sexuality. The course examines the relationship among visual texts, rhetoric, and spectators/viewers. It will concentrate primarily on a range of interpretive and critical approaches for studying instances of visual communication. The course has been organized to foreground rhetorical actions: performing and seeing, remembering and memorializing, confronting and resisting, commodifying and consuming, and governing and authorizing. Class room discussions will feature twentieth-century illustrations and examples from contemporary U.S. culture. Students will read essays by researchers who study visuality from a range of rhetorical approaches. The course has been designed to help the student to improve his or her writing abilities. Students will write three papers demonstrating their ability to analyze and interpret visual texts. The method of instruction includes lecture, discussion, film and practice workshops. Considerations of gender, sex, race, sexuality, and class will be interwoven throughout the course materials and discussions.

         That Hillary Clinton shimmy in the first Presidential Debate of 2016—what emotion did it perform?  Was it joy, stress-relief, the pose of a happy warrior?  How much do we need to know about the situation she was in (her history, her opponent, US gender dynamics, the medium through which she was communicating), in order to understand the gesture fully?  This class thinks about the rhetorical power of emotions and the degree to which emotions are molded by culture.  We look at a variety of case studies: the “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” gesture via Google Images; the Japanese conception of iki; deadpan in the film, Mysterious Skin; and others.  We also consider emerging questions concerning emotions and technology: can an app help people on the autism spectrum understand emotions, and can CCTV security cameras recognize “nervousness”?  In this course, students have the opportunity to develop a project on an emotion of their choice.

         For the last one hundred years, Western culture has been ripe with images of young femininity: nubile fairies, wide-eyed ingénues, and pig-tailed temptresses illustrate children’s books, advertise consumer goods, perform on stage, and sashay in music videos. Although pervasive since the turn of the twentieth century, the adolescent girl is rarely depicted as a cultural agent. Instead she is perceived as a decorative figure that services, but never shapes, the consumer culture she visually represents. Alongside critical readings on media consumption, material culture, and feminist theory, this class will expose students to the rich world of girls’ cultural production, from Mary Pickford to Sylvia Plath and Taylor Swift.

         This capstone course designed for senior Film Studies majors focuses on two concepts central to current theoretical discourse in the field:  “media” and “spectatorship.”  Although students will have surely encountered these terms in previous courses, this seminar demands an in-depth, advanced investigation of their formulation and intersection in order to discuss contemporary debates at the heart of film studies scholarship.  What does it mean to be a spectator of cinema?  Is the film spectator different from the spectator of related media, such as television or digital art?  How do we “watch” with our bodies as well as our eyes within and across different forms of visual media?  Do certain genres apply pressure to theories of spectatorship relying on psychoanalytic, cognitivist, phenomenological, or other conceptual frameworks?  How do issues of gender, nation, history, identification, and reception shape our notions of both media and spectatorship?  Demanding, critically complex readings in film theory and film history will open up our discussion of such questions, and students will pose (and answer) questions of their own in essays, presentations, and weekly journals.

         This course will work through large parts of Wittgenstein’s second great book, Philosophical Investigations (PI), including both the discussions of rule-following and of the privacy of sensations. PI is by design a difficult book to read. It contains little by way of extended exposition and argumentation. Rather, the book is divided into fairly short numbered remarks. Often these remarks take the form of questions or dialogues between a Narrator, who often represents Wittgenstein, and an Interlocutor. The study of PI accordingly requires the active participation of the reader in these exchanges. Course sessions will then be a mixture of lecture and discussions in which every student will be expected to participate. Besides PI, reading for the course will include readings from Wittgenstein’s other writings as well as some secondary literature.

         The Russian Revolution of 1917 was the most radical revolution in history and had a profound impact on 20th century world history. The Bolshevik Party, which seized power in November 1917, sought not simply to change governments or the laws of the land, but to smash the old order and to challenge the assumptions upon which all governments had hitherto ruled and all economies had been based. As we know, the Soviet experiment did not endure. The USSR's collapse in 1992 was as unexpected as its creation. This course will survey the history of the USSR. The course will pay particular attention to why the old order collapsed, the ideals that drove the early Soviet state, its attempt to 'modernize' the country at a frenetic pace, the role of violence as a means of governance, its experience in WWII and its rise to world prominence, and its postwar efforts to balance the demands of 'mature Socialism' and superpower obligations. In the process, we will devote special attention to the state-society relations, the problems of economic development, and the tensions between revolutionary ideas, and economic and political realities.

Students will be able to understand the evolution of nation-states out of multi-ethnic dynastic empires, modern nationalist movements, and the advent and end of communism. In addition to regular reading assignments, students will view films that relate to the historical themes under review. Evaluation will be based on homework assignments, mid-term exam, map quizzes, essays, group work, and class participation.

         Over the last several centuries, Eurasia’s domination by successive nomadic steppe empires (stretching from Europe to China) was displaced by new imperial challengers from the periphery (notably Russia, China, and Britain). This course examines the nature of that transition by charting the history of Eurasian empires, beginning with the Mongols in the thirteenth century and proceeding through the present day. From Ghenghis Khan to Tamerlane to Stalin; between Russian spies, Chinese armies, and the Taliban; spanning silk roads, great games, and more. The empires of the steppe were truly vast in scale, integrating territories usually studied in isolation from one another, and so this course provides important context for separate courses on Russia, Eastern Europe, China, and the Middle East. The chronological scope of this course is similarly epic, spanning over seven centuries, and thus placing in relief recurring themes related to empires in world history. The thematic emphasis is on geopolitical strategies for imperial rule, but the course will also examine culture, religion, and political economy.

         Shortly after completing the first draft of the human genome in 2000, geneticist J. Craig Venter famously declared that, “race is a social concept, not a scientific one.” While many believed that Venter had offered the last word on the matter, recent debates concerning the validity of race-based medicine illustrate that the meaning of race and its role in the determination of human difference remain open questions. This course is designed to offer History majors an introduction to the craft of history. Concentrating on the period since the 17th century, source material is drawn primarily although not exclusively from the United States. The course will focus on the historical use of race as a biological concept informing ideas about physical ability, intelligence, criminality, disease outcomes, and reproduction. Students will hone their historical skills through in class discussions, the use of primary and secondary sources, and by writing three short analytical papers.

Mass Violence In 20th Century

    Thum,Gregor 

         “Ethnic cleansing” and “genocide” are neither twentieth-century phenomena, nor is their occurrence linked to any particular region in the world. However, during the two world wars and their aftermath acts the civilian population of Central and Eastern Europe experienced a degree of mass violence that not only changed to face of the region but also led to the establishment of the very term “genocide“. The Holocaust stands out as the most comprehensive, most radically executed case of genocide in modern times. Yet it was embedded in a wider context of systematic violence against various populations in Central and Eastern Europe. Rather than beginning with a general, abstract reflection on the reasons for the various forms of mass violence from ethnic cleansing to genocide, this course allows students to explore the specific social, cultural, and political conditions under which the sometimes entangled cases of mass violence against civilians occurred in twentieth-century Central and Eastern Europe. The course concludes with a general reflection and discussion of the concept of “genocide“, the limits of its analytical usefulness, and the political baggage it carries.

         Food and its preparation and consumption exist in every culture and throughout all human history, yet the meaning and significance of what we eat is never static. A rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but our tastes change over time—garlic, “the stinking rose,” was once considered a breath freshener and aphrodisiac. In this course we will explore such diverse topics as the medieval banquet, food and cultural identity, famine and food shortages, and the history of chocolate. This course will also include several tasting assignments.

         Debates over Russian national identity is often framed around whether Russia is an “European,” “Asian,” or something wholly unique, a “Eurasian” nation. Despite these debates, Russia is often juxtaposed against Europe. Europe is the measurement of its modernization, its political system, and its power. However, the question of where Russia fits geographically and culturally—“European,” “Asian,” or “Eurasian”—begs the question: What is Russia’s place in world history? How have encounters not only with Europe and Asia, but Africa, the Americas, and the Middle East shaped its place in the world over its long history? Attempting to answer these questions will help unlock the basic, yet complex question, of what is Russia?

         This is a course about the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Chinese history, from 1344 to 1912. Late Chinese imperial history can be understood from a variety of perspectives. This course will focus on two of the most compelling of these—the intertwined evolution of economy, culture and state, and the history of attempts by the imperial center to control the borderlands and extend imperial power. These approaches mean we will pay attention to changes in late imperial China, but we will also pay attention to attempts to maintain stability in the face of change by reemphasizing tradition. We will explore these topics through lectures, and readings, and much discussion.

         This course explores the tumultuous decade of the 1960s in American society, politics, law, popular culture, and foreign affairs. Usually associated with sex, drugs, and rock and roll, the sixties produced dissent and division among the young and old.  Amidst the groundswell of colonial liberation movements around the world, Americans divided over the legitimacy and morality of overt and covert military operations abroad. Grass-roots mobilizations of African Americans and women for full citizenship rights produced a chain reaction of other discontented Americans. New immigration policies admitting foreign-born peoples previously barred from the U.S. since the 1920s redefined the U.S. population. Not since the 1930s had the federal government issued so many landmark laws expanding education, job training, housing, health care, and welfare. The sexual revolution and new lifestyles challenged notions of “proper” conduct and the meaning of privacy. Throughout the decade political assassinations, urban riots, and a succession of public demonstrations questioned how well U.S. democracy actually worked.

         This course explores the development of the frontier as both a physical space and an ideological construct. Therefore we will follow the concept and reality of the frontier from the 17th century to the 21st century, with a focus on its rapid development during the 19th century. Not only did diverse and distinctive frontier societies emerged from the processes associated with settling the frontier, but concepts related to race, religion, property rights, war, ethnicity, governance, finance and speculation emerged and were contested on the frontier. Since different and conflicting interpretations of the frontier experience have emerged over time and raise important questions and perspectives about the character of American society, we will read and analyze a wide range of historical approaches to this critical concept and period in American history.

         When did modernity start?  Is our society postmodern?  Are some societies more modern than others?  Should we altogether jettison the word “modernity?”  Modernity is not only a word whose use you may one day be asked to justify, it is also a gateway unto debates about whether humanity has progressed, about Western expansion, and about how to compare global societies.  The first part of this class will give you an overview of three key debates surrounding the concept of modernity: 1) whether modernity is primarily related to capitalism, to the nation-state system, or to transformations in forms of subjectivity, 2) how the temporal markers of modernity, early modernity, and postmodernity have been debated, and 3) how people in societies on the receiving end of Western expansion wrote about modernity and about its twin concept, tradition.  The second part of this class will look at actual uses of the concept of modernity by inviting half a dozen faculty members to discuss how they use modernity in their own work.  Although based in the history department, this seminar seeks to foster an inter-disciplinary conversation among students from a broad array of disciplines.

         This seminar offers a survey of European empires in comparative perspective. The sequence is loosely chronological, beginning with hegemonic powers from the 16th through 18th centuries, then lingering in the long nineteenth century of European global dominance, and ultimately examining how that age of empires shaped our own world. Geographically, it ranges from Britain to Russia to European colonies in India, Africa, and Latin America. Thematically, the seminar singles out, first and foremost, geopolitics, but also engages topics such as political economy, networks and exchange, warfare, and the development of “modern” categories of knowledge. Although rooted in historical methodology, the seminar also considers questions relevant to political science and anthropology.

In that literature, several questions recur: What have been the long-term legacies of Portuguese colonialism and African slavery in Brazil? How have Brazilians thought, talked, and acted about their multiracial, multicultural society? How have they struggled to resolve the contradictions between formal political equality (democratic citizenship) and extreme social and economic inequality? We will explore these and other questions in works drawn from the fields of history, anthropology, political science, and sociology.

Some scientists assert that we have entered the new geological epoch of the “Anthropocene” or the period in which human activity has become the dominant influence on the Earth’s geology and ecosystems. In addition, protests over pipeline construction, petitions to save bees from pesticides, the militant-occupation of government-protected lands, news of animal extinctions, and so on, continue to proliferate.

         This seminar concerns itself primarily with the history of rhetoric, and secondarily with the rhetoricity of historiography. In the first instance we will follow the standard epochal divisions (Graeco-Roman antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Modernity) with an eye to rhetoric’s typical domains (culture, politics, law, education, religion, art, science). In the second, we will consider various conceptions of history, how a history is made, and how it accounts for the past, the present and the future, that is, the continuities as well as the transformations of rhetoric. The reading include selections from: Bizzell and Herzberg’s The Rhetorical Tradition, Jacob Burckhardt’s The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, Friedrich Nietzsche’s “On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life,” Haydn White’s Tropics of Discourse, “History” in Ernst Cassirer’s An Essay on Man, Nancy Streuver’s The History of Rhetoric and the Rhetoric of History, and Victor Vitanza’s Writing Histories of Rhetoric.

         Psychoanalysis has experienced a renaissance throughout the humanities and is increasingly relevant to discussions of language, identity, affect, resistance, and neoliberalism. This course is designed to assist graduate students in developing a strong understanding of Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic works, especially in their relation to media, rhetoric, and cultural criticism. The readings will focus on Lacan’s primary works with background texts and secondary interpretations playing a smaller role in an effort to encourage students to make their own judgments and conclusions. The course will be organized around key elements of Lacan’s thought and their relationship to contemporary academic developments. Some central themes include: psychoanalytic concepts of affect and desire, the relationship between psychoanalysis and rhetoric as a practice of reading, theories of subject formation, trope, the sexual relation, and the drive. The class will also include a practical element on writing for publication. Syllabus available on request.

    King,Isaac Ogden 

         What is art?  This introductory course, designed for students with no previous background in art or art history, is intended to probe this question – and challenge traditional assumptions -- while providing students with the skills to interpret works of art and architecture from a diversity of world cultures.  The course is designed to demonstrate some of the basic tools of analysis with which to approach works of art as material and aesthetic objects while also examining them as productions that negotiate with historical and cultural contexts.  The course also thinks pointedly about cultural difference and the ways in which art has been employed to define communities as radically particular while also answering basic human needs that connect people living in different times and places.

         This course introduces students to western architecture from the ancient world until today. The course works both chronologically--as a history of phases and styles--and methodologically, examining the contextual issues that gave each period its distinctive architecture. Students who take this course will understand fundamental developments in our western architectural heritage and be ready to make critical judgments on buildings. The course also prepares students, if they wish, to take more specialized studies in the history of architecture or in any other branch of art history.

         This course looks at the development of architecture in Europe in one of its most important moments, from 300 to 1500.  Its main focus falls on buildings designed to serve Christian culture, including the glorious Gothic cathedrals, with discussions that give a social and political background to the buildings. We also look at the shaping of medieval cities and at infill buildings like houses, palaces, workshops and military installations.

    Beranek,Saskia R 

         The term Baroque is usually used to refer to the art of the 17th century, describing the dynamic and theatrical elements which emerged in the wake of the late Italian Renaissance.  The seventeenth century was an age where art furthered the agendas of absolute monarchy, religious reform, and global expansion.  This course will examine well known artists like Bernini, Carravaggio, Gentileschi, Rembrandt and Velazquez along with less commonly known ones, exploring how the arts were coming to terms with an expanding worldview in an age of exploration and colonization.  Major themes will include the role of the patron and the changing role of religion during a period dominated by the Counter-Reformation as well as how drama and emotional intensity involved viewers in new ways.  We will examine painting, sculpture, architecture, landscape architecture, and decorative arts from Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and their global colonies in order to understand how the whole world became a stage for the powers of the age.

         This introductory course is intended to provide a thorough familiarity with the history of photographic media from their development in the 19th century to the present day, and to link that history to major trends in the history of modern art, such as Realism, Impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, Abstract art, etc. The course construes "photographic media" in the broadest sense, so it also treats the history of cinema. It aims to acquaint students not only with the main uses of photographic media over the course of their history, but some of the main theories that have been put forward during that span for understanding photographs and films

         In the modern period Paris has been consistently held up as a model, not only for the quality of its urban life but for its very design. Few cities have so consistently served as the object of critiques of western capitalist society, of the industrial period’s urban form, and of the culture of ‘modernity’. Scarcely another city was so radically transformed during this period as this ‘Capital of the Nineteenth Century,’(Benjamin). In a mere two decades, 1850-1870, Napoleon III and the Baron Georges Haussmann collaborated to forge an image of urbanity for the national capital which became one of France’s major cultural exports by the late nineteenth century. While this famous episode will remain the central focus of the seminar, it will be situated in a longer history of urban debate and planning. We will be as much concerned with methods and tools of analysis for the study of modern urban form and the discourses of urban planning and reform as with the specific history of planning Paris.

         This is an introduction to pedagogy for graduate students in HA&A.  It is required for TAs with teaching assignments, and they should normally take it in their first or second year.  The course focuses on principles and practices of good teaching and uses hands-on methods to encourage students to gain confidence and share ideas.  We will also pay attention to new teaching practices that go beyond traditional classroom settings. The course will be a collaborative effort, where students learn as much from each other as from the instructor.  Each student in the course will develop a teaching philosophy statement and materials that will serve as the foundation for a professional teaching portfolio.

         What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework.This is a Hybrid course requiring students to attend scheduled workshops and participate in online discussions and activities.

         This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the feminist ideas and debates concerning gender, women and men, and their political, social and economic positions over the last two hundred years. While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses. Students will have opportunities to apply feminist theories to their work in their home disciplines. Students in the Dietrich Scholl of Arts & Sciences must consult their advisor prior to enrolling in this course.This is a Hybrid course requiring students to attend scheduled workshops and participate in online discussions and activities. Workshops dates: 1/21, 2/18, 3/25/2017.

         Having considered, in the fall term, the way in which Kant seeks to articulate our idea of ourselves as self-determining, and having seen how, according to Kant, our understanding of ourselves suffers from an ineliminable darkness, the attempt to transcend which is the source of so much illusion and deceit, we shall, in the spring term, study Hegel in order to see whether the darkness can be lifted without falling into rationalist and spiritualist ravings of the sort Kant so effectively exposed. We shall read parts of the Science of Logic, specifically the sections &#34;Objectivity&#34; and &#34;Idea&#34; in the Logic of the Concept. By way of introduction, we may read some early texts of Hegel’s, such as &#34;Verhältnis des Skeptizismus zur Philosophie&#34; and &#34;Glauben und Wissen&#34;.

         Beginning as a small farming settlement situated alongside the Tiber river, Rome rose to become one of the greatest civilizations in human history, which spread its influence over much of the western world. In addition to careful investigation into the social, political, military, and economic organization of Rome as it developed from a monarchy through a republic and into an empire, the class will examine the art, architecture, literature, religion, culture, and daily life of the city across the spectrum of social classes. The class will utilize the large body of surviving Roman literature, including histories, poetry, and personal letters (in translation), as well as visual aids, such as slides and films, to create a living picture of whom the Romans were. Class time will be used for lectures as well as student lead discussion.

         Gender, race and class are overlapping categories of experience that affect all aspects of life. There is perhaps no other context in which the effects of gender, race and class are as acutely evident as in the criminal justice system.  That is, the people who are processed through the criminal justice system are disproportionately male, nonwhite, and from the lower classes. This class is designed to examine the cumulative and interlocking effects of gender, race, and class on crime.

         This course is designed to provide students with a sociological perspective on medical beliefs, practices, and delivery systems.  The practice of medicine is embedded in a particular social system, and social factors have an effect on our understanding of illness, the distribution of illness in the population, how/where/by whom medicine is practiced, and also how it is paid for.  In addition, ethical decisions about life and death are based in social belief systems which evolve historically in response to technological developments and changing practice possibilities.  Students in this course will develop an understanding of how medical practices can be interpreted within a social and historical context, and will apply this knowledge to issues which are current in medicine today: the crisis in health care delivery, the effects of technological advances on conceptions of health and illness, the treatment challenge of multicultural patient populations, and ethical dilemmas in medical decision making. This is a CGS Web course with web based instruction and weekly web interaction is required. Students must have Internet access to take this course.

         The transmission of Buddhism to East Asia was a momentous development in the history of world cultures and religions. Not only did it precipitate major changes in the cultures of China, Korea, and Japan, it also was attended by a transformation within Buddhism itself. Beginning with an introduction to the basic concepts of Buddhism, this course examines the major doctrinal, meditative, devotional, and institutional traditions and themes within Chinese and Japanese Buddhism in historical perspective. Particular attention is paid to the problems of transmission of thought from one culture to another and to the ways in which Buddhism changed to meet those challenges and make itself relevant to the members of East Asian traditions. We strive to develop an awareness of how Chinese and Japanese Buddhism interacted with and helped to shape East Asian history as well as to cultivate sensitivity to and appreciation of East Asian Buddhism as a contribution to our understanding of the human experience.

         Drawing Studio 1 is designed to give both majors and non-majors a comprehensive introduction to the art of drawing. The course approaches drawing as a unique graphic and expressive medium rather than as a preliminary or planning process. The course begins from the point of view that the expressive and interpretative potential of drawing can be achieved at the beginning level when knowledge of drawing media and techniques are fused with personal vision and creativity. Drawing Studio 1 follows a sequence of studies that introduce students to basic drawing media and compositional elements through observation of natural and manufactured forms. The course culminates with an introduction to the human figure. It is not advisable to add this course after the second class meeting, as students will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of course work. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

         Painting 1320 is a capstone course for Studio Arts majors who want the opportunity to develop a suite of paintings for portfolio development. The course encourages self-direction, critical thinking and controlled use of media in the planning and execution of a group of paintings that are thematically and formally related. There is a strong expectation that students will devote a disciplined, sustained effort toward completing a portfolio of paintings that result from a thoughtfully crafted set of goals prepared at the outset of the term. A minimum two page artist's statement and proposal is required by the end of the first week of classes that describes the goals, media, and the number of paintings that the student expects to complete for the term. Students also write a reflection of their completed course work at the end of the term. Students are expected to provide necessary tools and materials, although canvas and gesso are available for students throughout the course for special assignments and projects. Evaluations will be based on effort, creative involvement, technical skill, preparatory work and productivity. The final grade will also reflect such factors as attendance, regular progress and presentations at class critiques. There is a $20.00 lab fee.

What would an alien species sound like? What kinds of changes will happen to languages over the next several centuries? Science fiction tropes like aliens, robots, and time travel richly reward linguistic investigation. In this class, we will apply current linguistic theory to various works of science fiction, asking first and foremost: “How linguistically plausible are the scenarios, tropes, and narratives depicted here?”

         Science is distinguished from other investigations of nature in that the claims of mature sciences are strongly supported by empirical evidence. Theories of induction and confirmation provide accounts of this relation of inductive support. We shall review the range of theories of induction and confirmation, including formal and less formal approaches. The review will be critical; none of them is entirely successful. The theories will be tested against significant cases of the use of evidence in science.

         Frequently conceived as a politically and economically isolated region, Central Asia, past and present, is in fact defined by movement of people, financial flows, and trade networks that embed Central Asia within the global economy. In the past Central Asian cities, located on the path of the Silk Road, were key nodes of trade, communication, and innovation, connecting the East and West. Today vast natural resources of Central Asia power the Chinese economy, and with its proximity to the Middle East, Central Asia is central to geopolitical games played by Russia, China, the United States, and the European Union. In this course, we will examine these contemporary global linkages anthropologically by reading ethnographic accounts of contemporary Central Asia as a ways to understand how people from the region experience and navigate profound economic and political transformations that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will read anthropological studies of the region alongside journalistic accounts and political science analyses of Central Asia as well as classic and contemporary social theory. The goals of the course are the following: (1) to complicate the grand narratives of nationalist revival, Islamic radicalization, and postsocialist transition; (2) to think afresh about issues of modernity, statehood, and development in the region; and (3) to place Central Asia within the broader global context. In this course, Central Asia is broadly defined as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Xinjiang (China), Turkic Siberia (Russia), and Western Mongolia.

         Was the world of Europe and the Middle East before the Enlightenment a period of unending religious conflict and intolerance?  Were Jews the victims of severe persecution and violence everywhere during this period?  Did Christians and Muslims engage in unceasing religious wars? The answer to all three of these questions is no. While the Middle Ages were a period of conflict and competition between the three major western religious groups, they were also a time of coexistence and cooperation. This class shifts from extreme dichotomies and simplistic stereotypes to deeply examine the period in all of its complexity: what were the theological, political, and legal contexts in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews interacted in both Christian Europe and the Muslim world?  How did these deeply religious societies organize themselves to tolerate the religious “Other”?  When and why did toleration break down and lead to expulsion, forced conversion, or violence?  What kinds of cross-cultural exchanges and cooperation take place in economic, cultural, intellectual, and social life?  We will also look at new ideas of toleration (and intolerance) that emerged at the end of the Middle Ages and examine aspects of inter-religious encounters and dialogues today.  We will discuss not only the significance of Jewish-Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle Ages but also assess these encounters as a case study in the broader history of religious diversity, pluralism, and conflict.

         This course has two objectives: 1. To understand religion and religious phenomena wherever and whenever found in human societies.  What is the diversity of religious phenomena, and what are the commonalities? 2. To understand how anthropologists and other behavioral scientist have explained religion and religious phenomena. That is, what anthropological and social science  explanations are available to us as we examine religion cross-culturally? What are the alternatives available to us as anthropologists to explaining religious things? One particular focus in the course will be the relationship of religion to national monarchies and cultural nationalism.  Other topics include witchcraft and sorcery, divination, myth and ritual, the differences between religion, magic and science, and revitalization movements and other theories of religion and cultural change.

Students will become familiar with the movements, practitioners, debates, and documents that shaped the transformation of art in recent decades. We will approach contemporary art from a global perspective to examine how artists working both within and outside of major art centers have interfaced with social, political, technological, and discursive shifts, while also positioning themselves in relation to preceding visual traditions. We will cover crucial art-historical issues that continue to inform art practice today, including—but not limited to—the relationship between art, politics, and activism; the rise of new media and the afterlives of painting; the politics of representation; the incursions between art and life; the “death of the author” and the solicitation of the spectator; art’s engagement with popular culture; and the global turn. Each week, we will discuss a combination of primary source writings, critical commentaries, and art-historical essays.

         For over a century, world's fairs were some of the prime places for people to learn about cutting-edge architecture, new technologies, foreign cultures, and even find entertainment. In the last fifty years or so they have precipitously declined in importance as their functions and appeal have been increasingly taken over by other events and venues. This course explores the design strategies used in the architecture of world's fairs in the first hundred years of their existence to attract and amuse visitors and market the items on view. We will examine the role of buildings and fairgrounds planning, on the one hand, to bring people together and promise a better future, and on the other, to reinforce existing class, political, and cultural structures and inequalities and even to fuel international rivalries, as well as their role in launching new architectural styles and movements altogether. The course will take advantage of and feature field trips to several Pittsburgh-area collections of material culture from international expositions, including those at Pitt, the Heinz Architectural Center at the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the Heinz History Center, and students will be expected to use items from them in completing class assignments.

         This course is devoted to lyapunov-based control design for nonlinear dynamical systems. Mainly, this course is developed as an introduction to nonlinear control. In the beginning, the course will emphasize the drawbacks of linearization and richness of nonlinear phenomena compared to linear dynamics. A brief introduction to study qualitative behavior of linear and nonlinear systems using phase portraits will also be provided. These topics will be used as motivations for this course where main topics include: lyapunov stability analysis for autonomous and nonautonomous systems, input-output stability, barbalat's lemma, feedback linearization, and nonlinear control design tools such as lyapunov redesign, sliding mode control, integrator backstepping, and other robust and adaptive control methods. If time allows, we will cover nonlinear control design methods for dynamical systems with delays. The content will be mathematical supplemented with application examples taken from robotics and human musculoskeletal system. Prerequisites for the course include an understanding of undergraduate calculus, linear algebra, and linear control methods (ME 2045). Students are also expected to be able to use some simulation software (e.g. Matlab).

         This course examines ethical and social issues that arise in connection with sport.  The course will be divided into two parts: the first concerns issues that arise within sport, such as using performance-enhancing drugs and seeking to injure opponents; the second concerns issues related to the integration of sport into society, such as whether there ought to be gender equity in sport (and what gender equity is) and whether sport has a legitimate place at institutions of higher education.

         This course examines artistic works produced in prison and artistic works about prison, addressing both the allure of the criminal world as a form of entertainment and the function of art within prison as escapism and survival technique. In structure the course is broken into three parts: the first part concentrates on prison writings and criminal culture in America; the second part focuses on the forced-labor camp system known as the Gulag in the Soviet Union; and the third part examines Europe (Germany and Eastern Europe) during the Holocaust.

         This course explores the cultures and societies of Africa from prehistory through the present. Beginning with an examination of traditional culture, we then turn to the cultural transformations, continuities, and dislocations experienced during enslavement, colonialism and the post-colonial situation. A comparative approach, drawing upon both ethnographic and historical sources, will illuminate these processes. While the course readings may refer to various countries and regions of the African continent, our in-depth analysis and comparison will focus mainly on three countries: Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ghana.

         The emergence of modern Islamic political movements worldwide has not only had a profound impact on contemporary global geo-politics but has also triggered heated debates around the question of the compatibility of Islam with liberal democracy. This course investigates the "vexed" relationship between Islam and politics, profoundly influenced by the experience of colonialism, and standing in complex relationship to concepts such as the modern nation-state, democracy, liberalism, or secularism. The course combines empirically grounded studies on the multiple facets of past and contemporary Muslim politics in Muslim-majority and minority contexts with a more theoretical investigation of modern Islamic political thought; here we examine the intellectual origins of Islamic politics, its arguments, and the challenges it poses to its liberal counterparts, but also its conundrums and contradictions.

    Lotz,Andrew Louis 

         This course focuses on a single notion: that states use narrative(s) to support their regimes. The class aims to prepare students for understanding how story, myth, propaganda, and indoctrination are used by various political actors to build, sustain, and/or destroy regimes. The course begins with a consideration of quintessential cases of states engaging in these practices (Ancient Rome, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge). We then turn our attention to the practice of Propaganda specifically, considering its modern origins in WWI, examining transitions in technique across multiple states, weighing linkages to advertising and public information campaigns, and finally having students construct their own propaganda. The third segment of the class turns the focus specifically to the United States, and how particular American myths are leveraged here (e.g. Manifest Destiny and the American Dream).

We consider what they are, their different manifestations, how they work, their consequences, and how these have been portrayed on film. This is not so much a course on film as it is a course about politics and issues of political theory and political morality as portrayed on film. We will use major commercial films and documentaries as case studies to explore some of the most fundamental issues of politics.

         Quantum mechanics is rightly heralded as one of the great successes of 20th century physics, and provides the framework for our best contemporary theories of matter and radiation. However, almost a century after its birth, it remains unclear how we ought to understand what the theory is telling us about the world. This course will be an advanced introduction to the conceptual problems that beset the theory and selected proposals for addressing them. Topics discussed will include (i) the problem of measurement, its main proposed solutions, and the role of decoherence; (ii) Bell-type theorems, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and the status of locality in quantum mechanics; (iii) and (if time allows) either topics at the interface of quantum and classical mechanics, or the conceptual motivation for moving beyond quantum mechanics to quantum field theory. No prior familiarity with quantum mechanics is required; all relevant background material will be introduced in class. However, the amount of mathematics required for a responsible discussion of the material is non-zero, and students will be expected to acquire the technical tools necessary for informed discussion.

         Observation and Experimentation have long been taken as central to the legitimacy of scientific claims.  Richard Feynman wrote “The test of all knowledge is experiment.  Experiment is the sole judge of scientific ‘truth’” (1963).  But how do experiments reveal the way nature is organized? In this course we will explore a range of topics in the philosophy of experiment, including underdetermination and theory-ladenness, replicability, techniques and norms of experimental practice, the relationship between experimentation, theorizing and model-building and the new challenges of digitization and big data.

         Are science and religion at odds with each other? Are they complementary and harmonizable? Or do they represent completely separate domains of human inquiry? In this course, we examine the relations between science, rationality, and technology, on the one hand, and faith, religion, and religious texts, on the other, and examine how these questions have been answered throughout history, particularly in the Western monotheist faiths (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Islam). Special attention will be given to the interpretation of creation accounts in the ancient world, views toward science and medicine in the Middle Ages, the scientific revolution, and various religious approaches to evolutionary theory. We will also consider the relationship on practical, contemporary issues such as racism and science, neuroscience and religious practice, as well as ecology and faith. Some of the guiding themes that will shape our discussion include the compatibility of religion and science throughout history, the possible mutual benefits between the respective discourses, and what role religious communities play (and have played) in scientific and environmental concerns.

         How can scientists, statisticians, and other researchers distinguish causal relationships from those that are merely correlational?  Why is this distinction important for medical research, public policy, and decision-making in everyday life?  This course examines these questions and reasoning about causality in general. This course includes a web-based format for the textual material, exams, and virtual "Causality Lab." Students will use this lab to analyze simulated experiments, construct causal theories, derive predictions from these theories, and test predictions against simulated data. While the course materials are available on-line, students attend a weekly session for case study analysis and course material review.

We will explore the mythic cycle of Creation and Osirian cycle of betrayal, revenge, death and rebirth, as well as the place of myriad local and minor deities within Egyptian mythology. We will also consider the dynamics of the "monotheistic" revolution of Akhenaton. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Egypt, students will encounter the interaction of sacred and secular, and the relationship between state cults and private worship by nobles and commoners alike. A special feature of the course includes sessions at the Egyptian Exhibit of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and designing public educational materials that will help illuminate this ancient culture.

Additionally, this course will introduce you to some of the fundamental debates in Cognitive Science and highlight the ways these debates influence current psycholinguistic research. In this course you will see how different fields such as Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science all inform theories of how we understand and use language. Prerequisites: Either Introduction to Linguistics or Introduction to Psychology. Cognitive Psychology is highly recommended. Target audience: Advanced students in Linguistics, Psychology, or Communication Science and Disorders. Prerequisites are kept minimal so that students from all these fields can take it, but the readings are difficult if you don’t have much background in Linguistics or Psychology. Topics Covered: Introduction to syntax, introduction to pragmatics, nature vs. nurture in language, rules vs. probabilistic approaches to language, modularity in language comprehension, individual differences in language comprehension, working memory in sentence comprehension, mental representations of discourse, text inferencing, reference and coherence, depth of processing, prosody in production and comprehension, utterance planning, disfluencies, audience design, priming in conversation, figurative language, and language and thought. Requirements: For every class period, there are one or two assigned readings- most are 5-20 page articles from premiere scientific journals like Cognition, Journal of Memory and Language, Psychological Science, etc., that you can access on-line. There is no textbook, although there is a course packet that it is possible to make do without, but easier to have. Students are responsible for submitting a reading response on Courseweb before almost every class. There are two essay exams: a midterm and a cumulative final. For each one, students will get a set of possible exam questions approximately a week before the exam and then a subset will appear on the actual exam. Students will also be required to write a 10-12 page research paper on a topic related to the topics we discuss in class or looking deeper at an issue we discuss in class. This paper will be written in stages, with multiple drafts. There are additional small homeworks throughout the semester that aim to relate things we are talking about in class to real life. Participation is very important in this class. Participation grades will be based on attendance and amount of class participation. Texting/using your phone during class will result in severe negative consequences for your participation grade.

         Content, Purposes and Methods: The content of this course is the study of how language is produced, comprehended and used by normal adults- focusing on those processes above the word level. Content areas that will be addressed include: Basic introductions to syntax and pragmatics as studied in linguistics, major debates in cognitive science that are applicable to the study of language, sentence comprehension- an area that has been traditionally linked tightly with linguistics and syntax, discourse comprehension- an area that has been more studied from the perspective of psychologists interested in memory and reasoning, sentence production, conversation, pragmatics, figurative language and the relation between language and thought. There are two main purposes of the course in addition to teaching the students the content. The first is to introduce students to major debates in cognitive science such as modularity vs. interactionism, empiricism vs. nativism, symbolic rules vs probabilistic constraints and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Most of these issues will be laid out at the beginning of the course, and they will continue to be debated through the semester as we discuss theories of comprehension and use that fall on both sides of the debates. The second purpose is to give students the flavor of interdisciplinary work, as we will read papers and chapters from work in linguistics, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology and computer science. Students will be encouraged to think about the different perspectives brought to this material from each of these different fields. This course will include some lecture and significant amounts of discussion. One requirement of the course is a short written response to the reading assignment for each class, as well as two questions for discussion raised by the reading. The point of this requirement is to facilitate class discussion. Preparation: Students are required to have taken either Introduction to Psychology or Introduction to Linguistics. Students who have learned about the study of language through other means, for example a class in Artificial Intelligence, will also be considered qualified to take the course. Students will be expected to be able to read and understand (with help from class discussion) journal articles, as well as be able to do a brief literature search and write a research paper.

    Weinkle, Jonathan 

         The American culture of the 20th and 21st centuries has been called not death-defying, but death-denying. It is often said that America is the only place in the world that treats death as optional. Once upon a time, we could not have open, public conversations about breast cancer, because the word could not be uttered aloud. In many places, it is just as hard today to have an open, public conversation about death and dying. This phenomenon is not just a social more; it affects the practice of many professions and entire segments of our economy and society. This course explores our individual and cultural reactions to mortality, religious ideas about death, the ways in which dying in today’s America is different from dying throughout history or elsewhere in the world, and the responses of a variety of professions, both within the field of healthcare and beyond, to their encounters with people in the various stages of dying. Students will be asked, at turns, to be scientific, philosophical, clinical, analytical, and emotional in encountering the concepts and material presented here. This should be a true interdisciplinary experience.

         This seminar will be about the nature of vagueness and its epistemic role. The first part of the course will focus on what vagueness is. We'll take up questions such as: Is vagueness simply a linguistic phenomenon? Are there vague propositions? Could there be vagueness in the world? The second part of the course will focus on the cognitive role of vagueness. We'll take up questions such as: What attitude should a rational agent take towards P, if they think that P is vague? Does vagueness provide a barrier to knowledge, and if so, what is the nature of the barrier? We'll read a selection of classic and more recent work. Authors will likely include: Fine, Field, Keefe, Williamson, Graff-Fara, Dorr, Hawthorne, Magidor, McGee, and Bacon.

         This course is designed to build foundational acting skills using Stanislavski-based exercises such as those devised by Sanford Meisner, Stella Adler and/or Uta Hagen. These exercises aim to develop the actor’s ability to listen and respond truthfully in the moment, be present and connect, work with spontaneity, build concentration, and incite the imagination. Students will learn to craft behavior by working on contemporary text and engaging in improvisational exercises with partners as well as a series of solo projects. Students will also explore given circumstances and actions/objectives while working on audition techniques with a monologue. Students will then apply textual analysis skills and build rehearsal technique by bringing him/her-self to life in a role in a scene.  This course is a building block and prerequisite for other performance courses in the theatre department. Students interested in the Theater major or minor or who have theatre experience are encouraged to audition into this course (in lieu of Introduction to Performance).

         This course is designed to introduce students to the foundational elements of the musical theatre performer’s process and to examine the use of song in a theatrical context as a mode of human expression. Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of vocal structure and technique as well as physical and vocal presence in front of an audience within the context of specific genres/ style periods of musical theatre. Fundamental acting techniques will be developed in the context of musical theatre practice through the use of regular warm-ups, theater games, improvisation, and study of song texts. Each of the three main units of the course—ensembles, duets and solo songs—will culminate in a public performance of the pieces studied in class. Standard professional practices for musical preparation and auditions will also be addressed and will include a mock audition process at the end of the term. Students will be required to attend a full production of a musical and will develop critical analytical skill through written reflection on that production as well as on their own development throughout the term.

         Helen of Troy, Sappho, Pericles' lover Aspasia, and Cleopatra, Achilles, Pericles himself, Plato, and Alexander the Great. These are names familiar to many of us, but to what extent was these individuals' gender an element of their achievement and fame? This course attempts to answer this question by examining the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations from the perspective of male and female. We shall proceed by topic, focusing on legal status and citizenship, marriage, the family, the citizen life course, public roles, education, sexuality, religion, popular attitudes, and the views and conceptualizations of ancient social and political theory. Throughout we shall isolate and discuss factors determining or conditioning the peculiar features of the gender roles before us and especially those that seemed to have prompted departures from the prevailing norms. Readings will include a historical narrative, a reader of excerpts from primary sources arranged by topic, and a selection of Athenian comedies and tragedies. The course material will be illustrated by films.

         What was/is a "pagan?" And what does "paganism" have to do with Christianity? This course introduces students to religious texts and traditions in a formative era of Western civilization and culture. Our focus is on the variety of religious expressions in Greco-Roman culture, which flourished in the geographical area of the Mediterranean basin during the first five centuries of the Common Era. By considering such topics as debates about the nature of the gods and access to them (through oracles, ritual, and magic), the emergence of the idea of the holy person, and a variety of religious traditions as expressed in prayer, ritual, and art, students encounter a rich religious imagination that is truly different from contemporary understandings of religion and yet strangely familiar. We also explore the integration of religion and politics in the ancient world.

         The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrence that provokes a variety of human responses. In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death.

         Music scholars often spend a great deal of time thinking about music, but comparatively little thinking about the craft of writing about music. What makes a good writer of music scholarship? Who is your audience? What/who are good models? What makes a good “story” in musicological writing? How do non-academic forms of writing help the writing process? What does it mean to have a “voice” in your writing?

Particular emphasis will be placed on theories, methods, and practices developed within the fields of ethnomusicology, anthropology, and popular music studies. The course has a strong practical component in which students will conduct exploratory fieldwork projects in the Pittsburgh area. The course will present methods and techniques related to three main components of field research: 1) preparation (research design and proposal); 2) fieldwork (studying and documenting musical life in situ) and 3) ethnography (interpreting fieldwork experience and writing about it). Students will learn to develop practical skills including interviewing and eliciting techniques, the use of audio and video technology, and archiving and storage techniques. We will examine the history of ethnographic representation as a discursive practice that raises questions of authority, power, and cultural critique.

         Music is present everywhere in American life.  Its functions are many but are rarely articulated.  This course, designed for upper-level undergraduate students, presents a theoretical model for understanding music in cultural and historical perspectives and applies the model to American history and to students’ personal experiences.  Students examine the types of organizations and environments through which music occurs at home, in religion, public entertainment, media, and business, along with the associated roles and values of music for the participants and consumers.  Course materials include readings, recordings, musical events and current media.

         This course will consider how gender and sexuality as analytical categories can illuminate complex issues in various genres of black popular music.  Black popular music genres (blues, jazz, soul, funk, R&B, hip hop, reggae, contemporary gospel, and more) have become a major force in the American and international music scene. These various genres of African American origins have been performed by people with a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds all over the world. Music videos, especially in hip hop, often display women’s bodies as mere sexual objects, which legitimizes violence against women. In addition, the music industry has been largely dominated by cis-gendered, heterosexual men. What does “black” mean in the context of popular music? Why are disturbing, sexualized images of women so common and popular? How have minority groups such as women, non-heterosexual, and transgender artists carved out their places in black popular music in recent years? We will examine these issues through critical analysis of academic/journalistic writings, music, music videos, and films. Topics to be discussed will include: sexual politics in classic blues women, homosexuality in contemporary gospel music, violence against women and misogyny in rap music, hypersexuality and feminism in black female artists, black masculinity in hop hop culture, musical borrowing and cultural appropriation, transgender artists in black music, and women in the #blacklivesmatter movement. Non-music majors are encouraged to take this class (no music prerequisites).

It will include a discussion of the nature of inquiry in anthropology;  the development and implementation of different kinds of designs to investigate a range of types of questions asked in anthropological research; issues of sampling and informant selection; ethical questions in anthropological research; and the appropriateness of specific designs, including both qualitative and quantitative designs for different theoretical approaches. Several key methods will be discussed and practiced, including:  participant observation; key informant interviewing; design of structured, semi-structured and informal interviewing guides and questionnaires; structured observation; life history interviewing; and the collection of oral history materials.   We will also explore several methods for the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data.  Students will be expected  to complete a practicum assignment  in which they will identify a research question, develop an appropriate design, use several methods to collect and analyze data to address the question, and write a report in the format of a journal article.

         This course focuses on a number of historical and contemporary issues that can be illustrated by incorporating a human ecology focus into a cultural anthropology perspective.  Ecology is concerned with the place of human habitats in the wider life-world and how humans create and adapt to the landscapes they live in.  Today, as in the past, these landscapes and the biosphere in which they belong, are threatened by environmental disasters, climate change, and ideologies of development that strain the overall capacities of the world to sustain an adaptive coexistence.  The course incorporates the new subfield of “disaster anthropology”.  It also includes a focus on the anthropology of the body and the intersection of cultural and biological factors that constitutes human lifeways.  Ethnographic cases from around the world are drawn on with especial reference to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. A further theme has to do with the effects of conflict and the displacement of people, causing a global problem of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

         Undergraduate Seminar. Blood is an enticing substance. It ties people together, even when it is spilled. Just as blood produces social bonds, it divides people and groups according to notions of family, race, class (think “blue blood”), and nationhood. Blood both sacralizes and pollutes, fascinates and disgusts. Blood can infect; it also makes people swoon. Blood also seems to guarantee instant blockbusters and bestsellers. How can this fluid (mostly water, as we know) do such important social and symbolic work? This course takes blood as a thematic through which students can begin to explore topics that have long been at the core of anthropological investigation: kinship and family (including reproductive technologies and adoption); race and nationhood; ideas of pollution, infection, and contamination (also in contemporary medical practice); and rituals of incorporation and transformation (including, of course, vampires).

         This course will analyze the various processes and institutions through which gender roles are defined and shaped in our society.  It will analyze the interaction between individual conceptions of gender and larger social institutions such as the family, the workforce, the media, religion, etc. The current changes in these roles will be related to changes in other social institutions.  We will also examine the multiple forms of inequality in our society--based on sex, race, class, and sexual preference--and see how they interact.

         This course explores the nature of political parties in the United States.  We will learn about the history of elections, the current state of party politics, campaign finance, the role of parties in government, and the evolution of the political campaign. The course pays particular attention to the double-edged sword of parties’ current role in American politics.  Primary questions we will engage include: Why do party leaders make the decision they make? Why do voters follow party leaders’ cues? Is there any hope to overcome the partisan gridlock that seems to undermine good governance?

         Our emotions can seemingly rule our daily lives. Feeling happy, angry, or sad can influence the things we do and the decisions we make. Why is that? And what causes us to experience an emotion in the first place? In this course, we will explore these questions and focus on the links between emotion, cognition, and the brain. Our goals are to understand a) how the brain processes and regulates emotions, b) the interaction of cognitive processes and emotions, and C) how biological programming and our individual experiences interact to give rise to our emotions. Throughout the course, students will be exposed to empirical research involving humans and animals at a variety of levels: for example, neuroimaging studies, recordings from single brain cells, and examination of brain chemistry. The format of the course will include both lectures and group discussions of scientific papers. The broader intent is to hone critical thinking, listening, and writing skills.

         This is a forms course on "the manuscript." The manuscript you will be working on may be thought of as the initial draft of a chapbook or poetic sequence or first book of many poems. Students who take this workshop should be prepared to submit, midterm, a minimum of 20 pages of writing that must include both work the writer considers to be finished and work that is considered unfinished. This is a course in which we will pay attention to writing that might otherwise be left out of workshop discussion. During the second half of the workshop we will be examining new work that writers have produced in response to the initial discussion of their manuscripts. As part of the course we will also be reading half a dozen books of contemporary poetry all of which raise interesting questions about the form and architecture of the book.

         This course examines the mythology of adultery. Accordingly, it begins with the major European myth of adultery -- The Romance of Tristan and Iseult. Our primary focus, however, will fall on the screen adaptations of four nineteenth-century novels of adultery: Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Tolstoi's Anna Karenina, and Fontane's Effi Briest. In the corpus of films, we will distinguish between novel- and myth-oriented adaptations. Additionally, we will "read" and analyze graphic novels (comic books) based on these literary sources. Integrated into the course as cultural products of equal value, the verbal and visual texts will allow us to realize that the novels of adultery on a par with their celluloid and graphic-novel versions constitute the multi-faceted construct resting on the adultery myth. Exploring metamorphoses that the myth undergoes from one text to another will enable us to better understand the roots of the modern notion of adultery. Also, we will investigate the factors that transformed the novel Anna Karenina into the all-encompassing and the most influential narrative of adultery today.

         Having recently passed the 150th anniversary of the publication of Capital Volume 1, we recognize that our world has changed a great deal since its publication.  Yet, in reviewing many of these changes, it is not overstated to say that the works of Karl Marx have provided the transformational impulse.  Who was this person, Karl Marx?  Why is it that in this post-Cold War world his writings continue both to inspire and threaten contemporary readers?  How have those inspired by Marx further developed his ideas to constitute the discourse of Marxism?  These are some of the questions that this course will raise and try to answer.  We will begin with discussions of excerpts from key works by Marx in order to assess contemporary attempts at rethinking Marxism. Special emphasis will be given to the recuperation of Marxism since the 1960s through the Frankfurt School as well as the French and Italian tradition of autonomous Marxism. Students may use GER 1542 toward the German Major, provided they read specifically identified works of Marx and others in German and use German for designated  writing assignments. Language of instruction and all class materials will be made available in English.

         This course offers a historical and contemporary look at racial inequality in the United States through the lens of the city. As large-scale, concentrated spaces of wealth accumulation, poverty, habitation, education, social control, and, periodically, counter-hegemonic social mobilization, cities are and have been major sites of inequality generation and amelioration. With its abiding focus on how “the state” and “the market” combine to determine “who gets what, how, and why,” this course takes a political economy approach to race-making in urban America.

         This course explores the nineteenth and early twentieth-century forerunners of sociological thought and the development of sociological theory to the present. It selectively surveys the thinkers and schools of thought that were critical to the development of the discipline. The course begins with the works of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber and their contributions to our understanding of the development and effects of capitalism, he growth of bureaucracies, the modern division of labor, the exercise of power, the rise of individualism, and many other features of modern, Western societies. We will also read key texts by George Herbert Mead, Georg Simmel, and W. E. B. Du Bois, with special attention to their insights on the status of the self in modern societies. After our midterm, we turn our attention to critical theory, structural-functionalism, symbolic interactionism, phenomenology, and ethnomethodology— twentieth-century schools of thought that have significantly influenced the practice of present- day sociology. Next, we read works by Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu, who stand out, I believe, for their innovative approaches to power, sexuality, inequality, politics, subjectivity, the body, institutions, social space, and other subjects. For the last three weeks, we will explore theories of sex/gender and race, but instead of orienting our attention around particular theorists or theoretical frameworks, I’ve decided to focus on specific contemporary issues or topics. The first involves the issue of sex and gender and conflict over the use of public restrooms. The second centers on the issue of policing and race, in particular violence against people of color at the hands of police officers. We will explore how sociological theory can help us understand these complex issues.

         The state of the environment reaches the pages of our newspapers every day.  How did we get to this state?  Throughout history, human societies have made use of the environment as all human activity is dependent on through puts of energy and materials.  The course will seek to understand the social, economic, and political processes as they lead to impacts on the environment.  Far from being 'out there', the state of the environment is integrally related to the ways societies work.

         The objective of this upper-level course is to foster a critical perspective on the topic of “medicalization.” This term refers to the process by which medical definitions and practices are applied to behaviors, psychological states, somatic experiences, bodily processes, and other phenomena not previously under the jurisdiction of medicine. We will investigate the complex social, cultural, institutional and historical factors that contributed to medicalization (and demedicalization) in the past and the present-day conditions that fuel medicalization today. We will consider a broad range of examples: poverty, childhood deviance, alcoholism, homosexuality, childbirth, sexual pleasure, aging, diet, exercise, lifestyle, contested illnesses, deafness, shyness, inattention, unattractiveness, underperformance, and others. Along with these empirical examples, we will critically examine many of the claims and presuppositions behind various theories of medicalization, in particular, its connection with social control. The subject matter of the course will allow us to investigate a number of related issues and topics in medicine: medicine’s place in modern societies, its growth as a profession in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the present-day corporatization of medicine, the growing influence of the pharmaceutical industry, the rise of the patient-consumer, the role of health movements and patient groups in medicine, the impact of new technologies in medicine, and so on.

         World History is an ambitious and diverse subject, spanning in time from the days of the earliest hominids until the present. One thing that unites all people, in all places, at all times, however, is our need to eat. This course offers a “big picture” survey of world history by focusing on the changing ways in which humans have hunted, gathered, grown, harvested, processed, cooked, consumed, and talked about their food. In addition to exploring the place of food within a broad, global framework for understanding major trends in world history, we will also discover how distinct cuisines and cultural perspectives on cooking and consumption took shape in specific regions of the planet.

         Modern Chinese literature has been instrumental in fostering revolutionary and enlightenment objectives and reflecting and shaping social reality. Therefore it has always been taken as an essential window through which to understand Chinese political and social history. However, despite the close link between literature and politics, literature always reveals its ever-lasting aesthetic value that transcends the specific historical and political contexts. To appreciate both literature and its relationship with modern Chinese history, this course focuses on the canonical works in 20th century China. We will read influential fiction by modern and contemporary writers such as Lu Xun, Ba Jin, and Eileen Chang. Nobel laureates Gao Xingjian and Mo Yan’s novels will also be dealt with. In addition, Taiwan writer Wang Wenxing’s novel Family Catastrophe will shed some light on contemporary society and the literary field in Taiwan.

    Clift, Robert 

         In Representing Reality (1991), the first book-length study of documentary film within contemporary critical theory, Bill Nichols dispels the notion that documentary depends on an indexical bond between image and referent for its existence. The importance of the indexical to the documentary, Nichols proposes, is "less in the unassailable authenticity of the bond between image and referent than in the impression of authenticity it conveys to a viewer." Written at a time when the image was characterized by the loss of its referent, Nichols and other scholars probed the rhetoric of objectivity surrounding the documentary tradition. Some scholars, such as Vivian Sobchack, took a phenomenological approach to consider documentary "less a thing than an experience" designating a subjective relation between spectator and text. Other scholars revisited the history of documentary filmmaking, uncovering a history where the need to aestheticize, dramatize and even script reality was acknowledged before the 1960s and the shifting aesthetic made possible by smaller, portable equipment. Still others, such as Stella Bruzzi and Linda Williams, pointed to innovations in contemporary documentaries and nonfictional practices in order to outline the emergence of new modes of representation.

         Undergraduate Seminar. In this course we will read primary literature that is relevant to the study of human evolution, both neo  and paleobiologically.  After a brief overview of the separate histories, and thus foci, of paleontology in general and human paleontology specifically, we will begin formal reading with Blumenbach's two major works, some Buffon, Linnaeus, and Lankester (and probably a few others), Huxley's essays of 1863, Darwin's Descent  these basically on the topic of "man's place in nature"   and then delve into specific articles and monographs on the discovery, naming, and acceptance of human fossils.  These readings will cover (but not necessarily be limited to) the debate between Schaaffhausen and Fuhlrott, the naming by William King of the first new hominid species (Homo neanderthalensis), the works of Eugene Dubois (Homo erectus) and Raymond Dart (Australopithecus) and reactions to them, the Leakeys' discoveries at Olduvai Gorge, and some of the more recent finds.  We will also discuss Ramapithecus and its relevance to the still not satisfactorily answered question, "what is a hominid?"  The thrust of the course will be to tease apart fact from assumption as they were cobbled together in promoting one's favorite scenario on human evolution. Students will be expected to hand in annotated bibliographies based on the readings, and to take turns in leading discussion.  Each student will also produce a term paper that will expand on a topic relevant to the course.

         Game Design Games have become ubiquitous in our modern world. In addition to entertainment, elements of games are present in everything from promotional advertisements to university classrooms. This course focuses on the exploration of game design in its many permutations. Join us as we critique and design all manner of entertainment and serious game. The class itself is designed as a multiplayer game experience to immerse and engage the student in game design on a fundamental level. One of the final goals of this class is for each student to have designed two separate games in their entirety so that they can be implemented in the follow up course.

         This course is for all students who have an intellectual interest in the complex resources of some of our shared traditions as well as a healthy curiosity about the history of our present. In other words, this seminar will make available a demanding, but still selective encounter with works of high aesthetic, intellectual, and indeed even political importance. It is the assumption behind all humanistic education that citizens, leaders, and intellectuals require for proper civic formation, a thorough study of the most valuable resources that previous generations have left us. While no two-semester seminar can be exhaustive, we feel that a careful engagement with the materials on these reading lists provides far more than a good beginning.

Children in Pittsburgh

    Weikle-Mills, Courtney 

         "Pittsburgh is Kidsburgh” is the slogan of a recent advertising campaign highlighting the range of child-oriented institutions, programs, and activities available to children in Pittsburgh. Organizations like the Carnegie Museums, the Carnegie Libraries, the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, WQED and the Fred Rogers Company, Hope Academy of Music and the Arts, Pittsburgh Filmmakers, the Remaking Learning Network, the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Gemini Children’s Theater, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, and many others are continually creating spaces and developing programs aimed at fostering children’s knowledge of and participation in various forms of culture: from literature and poetry, to theater, music, and dance, to fine art, to new forms of digital communication and artistic production. This class surveys the range of cultural institutions serving children in Pittsburgh, with two main goals: (1) to see these institutions as a key part of the way childhood is experienced in Pittsburgh and similar cities across the United States, and to understand the historical background, social contexts, and political and cultural implications these institutions have on the experience of being a child today; and (2) to introduce students to a range of careers paths that make use of the historical knowledge and analytical skills cultivated in Pitt’s children’s literature and childhood studies courses. We will visit a wide range of institutions and host several guest speakers to survey the field of children’s culture in contemporary Pittsburgh. Students will conduct independent research into the history and composition of an institution of their choosing, and students will profile the career of an active professional in this field.

         We often make a distinction between the realm of the physical and the realm of the mind/experience/thought. For various reasons, most (but not all) sciences focus exclusively on the physical realm. However, to some extent this might seem odd--what could be more important than our own minds, of which we are most immediately aware and which might govern how we interact with the world in the first place? This course focuses on the mental. Are there rules that govern the mind? How does the mind relate to the body, and in particular the brain? Can we say anything illuminating about what it means to feel pain, have a desire, or (especially tricky) be conscious? We will look at contemporary answers to these and other related questions, primarily from the perspective of philosophy but with a heavy influence from cognitive science.

         Ethical dilemmas in the practice of health care continue to proliferate and receive increasing attention from members of the health care profession, ethicists, policy makers, and the general public as health care consumers. In this course we will examine a number of ethical issues that arise in the context of contemporary medical practice and research by analyzing articles and decision scenarios. Topics to be covered typically include the physician-patient relationship; informed consent; medical experimentation; termination of treatment; genetics; reproductive technologies; euthanasia; resource allocation; and health care reform. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify and analyze different philosophical approaches to selected issues in medical ethics; have gained insight into how to read and critically interpret philosophical arguments; and have developed skills that will enable them to think clearly about ethical questions as future or current health care providers, policy makers, and consumers. This course is part of a core sequence leading to certification in the Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate Program, and is a companion course to HPS 0612 (Mind and Medicine) but may be taken independently. The course is of particular interest to pre-medical and pre-health care students.

         With the rise of digital publishing, the essay has undergone a kind of renaissance. Not only are there more venues than ever for essayists to share their work, there are also more expansive ideas about what an essay can look like or sound like or do. In this course, we’ll explore the contemporary craft of the essay across media. Throughout the semester, you’ll read, listen to, view, and discuss a range of creative multimedia essays—from photojournalism, to narrative audio, to experimental video—and try out these forms for yourself in a series of independent audiovisual writing projects. Class sessions include a blend of discussion, workshops, and hands-on training in media production software from the Adobe Creative Cloud. You’ll come away with strategies for approaching all stages of the digital writing process, from generating ideas; to researching and collecting media; to scripting, editing, and revision.PREQ: ENGWRT 1310 or ENGWRT 1330; MIN GRADE:'C'FOR ALL LISTED COURSES

         A Knowledge of a foreign language is not required  This course introduces students to translation studies, important for an understanding of world literature.   The focus is on English versions of literary and film texts in other languages.   Students will consider the ways in which talented translators render influential literature and film, especially those that have gender as a central component, including Beauvoir’s America Day by Day and The Second Sex, as well as Anzaldua’s Borderlands and Franz Kafka’s Amerika.   We grapple with the following questions:  How do multiple English translations of the same text differ and what is the result?  How does one evaluate a translation?  Does gender, for instance, in Beauvoir, pose special problems in rendering a text into another language?  No pre-requisite in foreign languages required.

We’ll draw on literature (fiction, nonfiction, and poetry) and cultural theories of space, representation and archiving to frame our on-site experiences in writing and in digital forms.  We’ll also be testing how the skills of a literature classroom translate to these “real world” urban explorations.  The final project will involve assembling a multi-authored on-line guidebook to Secret Pittsburgh.

         The aim of this course is to introduce students to the analysis of foreign policy as a form of political behavior and to the specific factors influencing the foreign policies of several of the world's most powerful states. The lectures and readings follow several intertwining themes, covering: 1) the conceptual and analytical tools utilized to investigate and compare the foreign policies of states; 2) the nature of certain phenomena which present countries with complex and dangerous international problems, e.g. security, interdependence; 3) the particular sources, processes and outcomes involved in the foreign policies of several states including the United States, Russia and others. The approach is analytical and though some of the readings and lectures are historical, the emphasis is on the contemporary context. It is also comparative, offering students a look at how these states' domestic culture, processes and institutions affect their foreign policies.

         The objective of this course is to present a detailed analysis of our understanding of the functional organization of the human brain. This is accomplished by discussing disturbances of function, which are found in neurological diseases. The disturbed function is then analyzed in the context of our understanding of the normal function of the brain as this is derived from study of the intact human brain and animal experimentation. The course progresses from simple problems of motor and sensory processing to complex functions such as memory, language and cognition.

    Jablonka, Eva 

         The course focuses on two major concepts: biological organization and evolution. We will analyze the notions of "organism", function, goal, semantic information, and evolutionary adaptation. The first week will be devoted to an introduction to the philosophy of biology, using Godfrey-Smith’s short book (2014) as the basic text. Over the next 6 weeks we will study from a historical-philosophical perspective, the notion of the organism and of organization, using the machine metaphor developed in Riskin’s book "The Restless Clock". In parallel, we will read classical texts including Aristotle (chapters from De Anima), Kant (chapters from the Critique of Judgement), Lamarck (chapters from Philosophical Zoology), Darwin (chapters from The Origin), and Woodger. The next 8 weeks will be focused on an analysis of ideas about organization, autopoiesis, autonomy and self (based on readings of Varela and Maturana, Thompson, Moreno, Nicholson, Tauber, Pradeu); function (Cummins, Wright, others); biological information (Oyama, Maynard Smith, Jablonka, and others); evolutionary adaptation, which will include a discussion of levels of selection, and a notion of individuality based on Okasha and others. We will conclude with an introduction to the extended evolutionary synthesis. The course is designed for both philosophers, who can explore some of the central organizing concepts of biological investigations, and for biologists who wants to understand the conceptual foundations and presuppositions of their science. The students will read primary historical and philosophical texts and engage in discussions. The format of the course will be a combination of lectures and discussions. Students will be asked to submit a half page summary or "abstract" of the material they have been asked to read each week.

         This course will provide a hands-on education in how to make an independent/micro budget feature film that highlights a local Pittsburgh community.  The project for this course is the upcoming independent drama “The Rehabilitation of the Hill District.”  The film follows the journey of Gwendolyn Livingston, a wealthy, young African American woman who has been charged through the family business to develop the Lower Hill District into a commercially successful enterprise. In meeting and falling for a woman from the local community, Gwendolyn is confronted by the realities of how her redevelopment project will impact the personal lives of those in the Hill.

         Techniques in Performance Pedagogy is designed for graduate students to address the unique needs of teaching theatre performance at the college level. Students will examine various Stanislavski-based training methods and compare those methods with physical and/or ensemble-based methodologies as they apply to university training programs (in a BA, BFA or MFA program).  Students will formulate their own style and teaching philosophy as they develop lesson plans, create innovative pedagogical exercises, conduct warm up sessions, coach acting scenes and develop methods of grading performance work.  In addition, students will create a sample master class in order to be competitive on the academic job market

         The undergraduate research experience opens horizons for students to envision pursuing scholarship as a profession. What does it mean to be a professional scholar? How have such conceptions changed through time, and what might the future hold for those who aspire to a “life of the mind”? The academic research profession increasingly calls on scholars to explain their work to researchers from other fields, frame their research findings as useful contributions to society, and interact with public audiences. Hence a communication-based perspective provides a useful point of departure for students from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities alike to explore these opportunities and challenges in a collaborative, interdisciplinary seminar setting. Assignments include interactive reading exercises, an Open Access digital repository project, reading quizzes, and a final paper.

         We will collectively read contemporary theatrical, political, theoretical and sociological works that engage with race in the United States, Black Lives Matter, white silence, and ally capacity building.   Some of us may be just learning how to talk about the above; some of us may live it daily.  Theatrical pieces—plays and performance—function as the spine for our work, around which contextual critical and historical works will coalesce. We will also actively engage with journalistic and social media, as well as films, music and dance, both in Pittsburgh and beyond. The reading and viewing materials in the course are inspired by American Theatre Magazine’s “Ferguson Theatre Syllabus” and Prof. Frank Leon Roberts’ (NYU Gallatin) Black Lives Matter Movement syllabus.

    Schlitt, David  

         For hundreds of years, the majority of Jewish life happened in Yiddish. On the eve of World War II, eleven million Jews spoke this rich, Slavic-infused Germanic language. After undergoing the demographic devastation of the Holocaust and experiencing marginalization of all kinds, Yiddish has survived as a linguistic chain that connects modern diaspora Jewry to centuries of Jewish civilization and culture. In addition to serving as a link to the Ashkenazic (Central- and Eastern European) Jewish past, Yiddish is key to some of the most exciting creative and cultural developments happening in Jewish life today. This course will serve as a lively introduction to Yiddish language and culture. By the end of the course, students will have the reading proficiency to work with basic Yiddish texts, and will be able to understand and conduct simple conversations. Students will learn the basics of Yiddish grammar and will be conversant in Yiddish culture, both past and present.

    Mora-kpai, Idrissou 

         This course, taught by African documentary filmmaker Idrissou Mora-Kpai, focuses on fiction and non-fiction film from African countries, ranging from the industry’s emergence in the 1950s to Nollywood productions of the present day. The early African cinema was distinguished by a strong political and social engagement. The strong political and social nature of the early films reflect on (post-) colonial relation between Africa and the West, the conflict between tradition and modernity, not to mention the gap between the generations and shifts in gender roles. With the arrival of new cinema cultures associated with the digital camera in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, the aesthetics and themes of the films diversify. These films, geared towards an African rather than Western audience,take their inspiration from daily urban conflicts around migration, unemployment, materialism, and big crime.

         Even before the United States became a nation, authors began writing our collective history, shaping our national memory.  The stories we have told ourselves about the origins of the nation and its literature have been of key importance to the ways we understand our culture, landscape, and identity.  Yet, our "origin stories" are often complex - rife with invention, revision, distortion, and omission.  In this class, we will focus on specific instances of cultural meaning-making (or "traditions") in American literature.  Along the way, we will consider larger questions about the relationship between history, fiction, and experience.

Unfortunately, this model which does not keep in mind the values or needs of the customer has resulted in a high number of failures for new product launches. What skills are thus needed in order to be entrepreneurial and succeed in the development of new chemical products within industry today?  This course examines the initial stages on how to approach chemical product design from an innovation perspective complete with the provision of the necessary technical skills to get the job done while placing an emphasis on the business and entrepreneurial skills required to be successful in the chemical product design business.

         This course explores violence and memory in Latin America by focusing on the long history of U.S. military intervention in Central America and the Caribbean. We will first consider the mid-nineteenth century invasions by U.S. filibusters  (?pirates?) and then turn to the lengthy U.S. military occupations of the early twentieth century.  Why did these U.S. interventions, typically made in the name of democracy, engender high levels of violence? And in what ways did the violence leave an imprint on local memories? Much of the course is geared towards guiding students through the stages of writing an approximately 15-page research essay based on primary sources, such as U.S. State Department records, newspapers, and testimonies. No Spanish-language skills are required for this course but students proficient in Spanish are welcome to use Spanish-language sources for their essay.

         The death of a loved one is an emotional and powerful occurrence that provokes a variety of human responses. In addition to writings describing their funerary practices, the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean region have left artistic representations of death and dying, built tombs, and objects associated with funerary rituals. The study of these texts, images, structures, and objects allows us to better understand ancient attitudes and reactions to death.

Classical Mythology and Literature


TuTh / 04:00 PM-05:15 PM / 37 CL 
    Scott, Wes 

         This course will be taught essentially as a literature course; that is to say, attention will be focused on how various authors of classical (chiefly Greek) antiquity used the traditional figures and stories of their culture's mythology in order to say things of lasting value about the conditions and problems of human life.  We shall begin with the emergence of the cosmos as recounted in Hesiod's Theogony and then take up each of the major Olympian dieties in turn, studying the ways in which they are depicted in other works of Greek literature, including the Homeric Hymns, various plays by Aeschylus and Euripides, and Homer's Odyssey.
