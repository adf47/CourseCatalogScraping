This survey will include Dixieland, ragtime, blues, gospel, spirituals, rhythm and blues, rock, and soul. Recitations: Fall and spring terms only. Students must enroll in one of the several recitation sections that are held during the week. These sessions provide an opportunity for the student to participate in group discussions and to explore the material covered in the lectures. Registration in both lecture and one of the several recitation sections is required. Students should be sure to register for both at the time of registration; students who register for one but not the other will very likely find themselves closed out of the course when attempting to add the necessary section during the add/drop period.

         Combined with LING 1579 This course is an advanced introduction to phonological description and analysis. Students become familiar with the prevailing theoretical proposals on various aspects of phonological structure including sound systems, assimilation, syllable structure, prosodic structure, stress and tone. Students also learn how to evaluate the relative merits of these proposals by testing them on sets of phonological data. This course should provide a solid basis for conducting further phonological research.

    Ricketts, Thomas

         Logic concerns itself with demonstrative reasoning, reasoning in which the premises of the reasoning imply the conclusion.  Implication is in turn a matter of form or structure.  One statement implies another if the logical structure of the two statements guarantees that if the first is true, then so is the second.  The study of logic then begins with an abstract analysis of language designed to reveal the logical form of statements. Armed with our analysis of logical form, we will proceed to a rigorous definition of implication and develop formal methods for ascertaining the implication of one statement by others.  The logical techniques the course introduces will give students an enhanced awareness of the logical structure of English statements, and so contribute to their ability to analyze critically both their own reasoning and the reasoning of others.

         In this course, we will explore three things that might contribute to a good life: happiness, virtue, and justice. We will draw on historical and contemporary sources to think about what each is, about what it takes to be happy, to be virtuous, or to be just. And we will explore the ways in which happiness, virtue, and justice support one another, and the ways in which they stand in tension. Must we be virtuous or just to be happy? If not – if happiness can come apart from virtue or justice – which ought we pursue?

The emphasis of the course is on a clear understanding of the underlying principles rather than on mathematical formalism and problem-solving (although some attention is given to these aspects of physics). This course is appropriate for non-science majors, and for those majoring in the social, psychological and life sciences that do not need the more mathematically oriented course required of engineering and physical science students (Physics 0174,0175). The introductory laboratory course to be associated with this sequence is Physics 0212 (see below). Credit will not be given for both this sequence and the Physics 0174, 0175 sequence.

         Undergraduate Seminar exposes the students to various aspects of being a physicist, a scientist and a responsible educated citizen in ways that academic classes do not teach. A variety of topics representing a wide cross section of recent discoveries in physics and related areas of natural sciences, history of scientific progress, outstanding scientists of the past and present, the role of science in society and many other themes are discussed. Students present reports on topics of their choice and moderate the discussions that follow. The Seminar aims to teach the culture of searching for new scientific information, to distinguish between good science and bad science, to apply analytical approach to obtained information, to boost one's confidence and speaking abilities when making public presentations and to help one learn how to be critical of oneself and how to identify one's weak spots. Students prepare posters for the Spring Undergraduate Research Fair.

         This is the second term of a two term Honors College introductory demonstration-lecture course in physics. The calculus is used in this course and the syllabus is essentially the same as Physics 0175. However, the scope of Physics 0476 is broader than that of Physics 0175 and subjects are covered in greater depth. Approximately half the term is spent on classical electricity and magnetism. Other topics include Einstein's special theory of relativity and introduction to modern physics and quantum phenomena. Three hours each week are devoted to lecture-demonstration and two hours to discussion and application to problem solving. This course is especially suitable for physical science majors, engineers, or any student who seeks an in-depth treatment of introductory physics in a calculus-based course.

         This course is intended to introduce advanced undergraduate students to modern physics experiments in a realistic research environment. Since the course requires a small number of experiments, each can be done with significantly more depth than normal undergraduate labs. Although there is a standard set of experiments and measurements, individual initiative from the students is encouraged. Recent projects include optics studies with a laser, radioactivity analysis, Mossbauer effect, study of scintillator properties with cosmic rays, Stern-Gerlach effect, atomic physics of the laser, pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance, and study of onset of chaos effects in a resonant circuit. Modern experimental techniques are emphasized, including the use of high vacuum technology, modern particle detectors, and small computers. A weekly lecture covers the physics of various experiments, the proper treatment of data, and related topics. In its 3-credit version (1626), this course qualifies as a W-course. The additional work associated with the extra credit is to be devoted entirely to a more comprehensive report writing. Students are expected to engage in substantive revision of their reports in response to the instructor's criticisms of the quality of the writing. The minimum amount of writing must reach a total of 20-24 pages for the term.

         This survey will follow the same format as Russian 0800, except that the readings will focus on four major twentieth century writers: Bely (Petersburg), Pasternak (Dr. Zhivago), Babel (Red Calvary), and Solzhenitsyn (Ivan Denisovich). Stories of more contemporary writers will also be read, including Bitov, Trifonov, Iskander, Sinyavsky, Petrushevskaya, Tolstaya, Shukshin, and Voinovich, depending on availability. Emphasis will be placed on the variety of prose narratives popular in the twentieth century, and on the emergence of new problems and perspectives and their expression in the twentieth century. This course is offered both as a sequel of Russian 0800 and as a separate course. It will presume some knowledge of literary styles, forms and devices which were discussed in Russian 0800, or in another equivalent literature course. A course in Russian or Soviet history is recommended, though not required. Students will be expected to revise their papers.

         This research seminar enables students to engage in a semester-length project to analyze an aspect of urbanism in an international city—the empirical focus this semester will be on capital cities in Southeast Asia.  Students are expected to draw from the skills they have assembled in Urban Studies and other courses to develop and conduct research on these important cities.  The writing-intensive course will include lectures exploring Southeast Asian urbanization, and workshops on developing the necessary research skills to implement research on distant cities.  Participants will become familiar with the conditions and challenges facing contemporary Southeast Asian cities, and with the extent to which comparative analysis is possible between this set of cities.

         A sociological internship is a type of Independent Study in which the student is, in some sense, employed in a non-academic position (usually as a volunteer but sometimes for pay).  Student interns are sponsored, guided and evaluated by a faculty member (usually the Internship Coordinator).  Interns are also directly supervised by an appropriate person at the internship site.  The experience gained by the student must have direct sociological relevance.  The normal academic requirements of an internship include a research paper, a daily journal and regular communication with the faculty sponsor.
